Attachment: spoke1.txt, The remote subnet can be routed over either the existing site to site VPN, or the DMVPN, but not both at the same time., Hi Philip I have a similar problem but using the OSPF instead of EIGRP. Just came to the point that is it possible to design an HUB and Spoke design but not allowing spoke to spoke connection using DMVPN.? I you have an input kindly reply to this thread.

I do not know if other clients/brands will work, but I guess it is not recommended., OK, I'm just trying to avoid anyconnect because from i heard is that you need to buy lic # for them. Home set up, If it's for home, all ASAs come with 2 free AnyConnect Premium licenses. You can even setup a clientless SSL VPN using those and not require any client software- just a browser. Purchase price for a small number of AnyConnect licenses is not very expensive for that matter. You can use generic third party clients for IPsec IKEv1 VPN (not for client-based SSL VPN)., are those 2 free license gone after they they associate to a user or are those 2 for 2users connected at a single point in time. Since I'am behind a consumer grade cisco all in one router(wifi,switch,routing), what port would have to forwarded or would I place the asa before the router., The included AnyConnect licenses are for concurrent connections.

We have a spoke and wheel topology between the branches and HQ. Each branch already has a tunnel to HQ but that doesn't mean they can talk to each other unless I put in static routes on the firewall from branch to branch. As the config shows we have a split tunnel between HQ and the internet. I have added a second crypto map entry for the tunnel between the 2 branches. The tunnel works between the 2 routers except for the UDP., If the tunnel works for other type of traffic (TCP, ICMP) it might be a problem with the application itself, a capture on the inside interface of the routers might validate this. https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/139686/configuration-example-embedded-packet-capture-cisco-ios-and-ios-xe Hope it helps-Randy-, Hello Eric, Is your UDP traffic unicast or multicast? If it is multicast it won't work until you change the encapsulation on the tunnel from IPSec to GRE. You can still add security by using an IPSec profile on that tunnel. Best of luck., Thanks narcis antonie, I was thinking along those lines but I wasn't sure that the point to point tunnel wouldn't work for UDP. I did packet captures from both LAN and it looked like one side was getting a UDP unicast packet but the other side was not. They had the same configurations. I also saw some multicast UDP broadcasts that I think needed to get through for the phone switches to receive. I decided to make a GRE tunnel and add the IPSEC on it..

It shows it encrypting/decrypting when sh session detail. I also see the ACL for GRE any any getting the hits. How can I also be certain that all of the traffic is encrypted as I think it is? Do more packet captures? How is the loopback interface used for the OSPF and would it work for the source interface in this situation? It has to go across the WAN and internet so I made the source the WAN interface. What improvements should I make? Can I restrict the tunnel to just host to host switches? Any suggestions?, As an improvement you can do ipsec without manually configurating the crypto maps (which is a pain the.... if you ask me) by using ipsec profiles. Here is an example: Start by creating an isakmp policy: crypto isakmp policy 1  encryption &lt;whatever encryption you need e.g. aes or des>  hash &lt;sha or md5>  authentication &lt;whatever authentication you want e.g. pre-share or rsa-sig if you have a digital certificate for the router>  group &lt;diffie-hellman group id> crypto isakmp key &lt;key you want to use> address &lt;corespondent physical interface ip address> [SM-optional]!! you must define the key only if you selected authentication pre-share in the isakmp policy. If, on the other hand, all your routers have valid digital certificates issued by a CA recognized by all of them and you have authentication rsa-sig in the isakmp policy, then you don't need a crypto key. The &lt; key you want to use > should be identical on the corresponding router You then need to create an IPSec transform-set (TS): crypto ipsec transform-set &lt;name of the TS> [transform 1 e.g. ah-sha-hmac] &lt;transform 2 e.g. esp-aes 256 > [transform 3 e.g. esp-sha-hmac]!!you don't necessarily need the authentication header (AH) transform, depends on how paranoid you are:P. In most cases the second and the third are enough.  mode &lt; tunnel (default) or transport >!!specifies whether to encrypt the L3 header or not along with the payload, default is ok Next you need to define an IPSec profile: crypto ipsec profile &lt;name of the profile>  set transform-set &lt;name of the TS> Next you need to apply the ipsec profile on the tunnel interface: interface Tunnel &lt;no of the tunnel>  ip address &lt;IP of tunnel> &lt;SM>  tunnel mode gre!!(this is the default I think)  tunnel source &lt;physical interface e.g. FastEthernet 0/0>  tunnel destination &lt;IP address of the corresponding router physical interface>  ip mtu 1400!!not strictly needed but good practice to compensate for the additional overhead of the gre encapsulation  ip tcp adjust-mss 1360!!same as above  tunnel protection ipsec profile &lt;name of the profile> In the end you need to configure the corresponding router accordingly and there you go, no access-lists and no crypto maps. For the routing protocol, you only need to ad the ip adresses of the tunnel interfaces to ospf. For the physical interface you can create a static route. Nothing else should be routed directly through the physical interface without being gre encapsulated first. As for the NAT, you need to research more the order of operations, but in your case i believe the nat is done after the gre encapsulation and ipsec.]",[5],1,2016-02-01,12868536,0,8,I have a site to site IPsec tunnel across the WAN from an 1841 to an 2811 router.

8,8,willowklan1,"[user1, asker, asker, user2, asker, asker, user2, asker, asker, user2, asker]","[PPTP is an old user to site VPN technology and should not be used any more. Note that PPTP uses GRE and a control channel under the hood. L2TP is a layer 2 tuneling protocol. For user to site VPNs it is often combined with IPSec, so you run L2TP over IPSec. I have never seen L2TP and GRE used together in a single environment. In the service provider world, PPPoE/PPPoA (aka customer connections) may be terminated on local DSLAM's. Perhaps not ever their own. Each customer connection can then be delivered back to their network core via L2TP. So the core sees an inbound L2TP dialler session for each of their customers., rewrote the questions and uploaded them again, I`ll try to the questions in a more tidy manner... 1) what is the difference between L2TP and GRE? they both need the ipsec and are just tunnels, while L2TP is also a dialer using PPP/PPPoe to connect to the ISP... 2) what is the difference beteween point-to-point protocol and point to point tunneling protocol? since they both support non-IP traffic 3) what about standalone PPTP (no GRE)? why do I want PPTP running inside a GRE? how do I benefit from this?also, why can`t I use PPTP with GRE and ipsec for security, or just PPTP with ipsec? why should I use L2TP? what is it`s benefits? 4)who is the dialer in GRE+IPSEC tunnel (or GRE standalone tunnel?) what protocol is used? what layer 2 is used to establish the connection? 5)when you say GRE uses protocol 47 and ipsec uses protocol 50 and/or 51 (esp/ah)- how do they both come together? how does an encapsulation look with both these protocols? what is used at each layer? 6)does LNS actually mean ""a L2TP server just insdie a router""? 7) if I come up with a GRE tunnel and ipsec, I still need to use L2TP as the dial-up at the client`s end, don`t I? what goes on at the client`s side, for establishing the layer 2 connectivity? I know I shouldn`t use PPTP in 2016, but still would like to know about it. thanks, Willow, Dear friends, Please allow me to join. 1) what is the difference between L2TP and GRE? they both need the ipsec and are just tunnels, while L2TP is also a dialer using PPP/PPPoe to connect to the ISP... L2TP is used to encapsulate and tunnel entire Layer2 frames (such as Ethernet, HDLC, PPP, ATM, or Frame Relay) including their payload. GRE is used to encapsulate and tunnel Layer3 packets (such as IPv4 or IPv6). There are other significant differences between GRE and L2TP but at this point, I consider this to be the most important distinction between them. In other words, if you consider a tunnel to be a pipe, then with L2TP, you would be feeding Layer2 frames into this pipe, and with GRE, you would be feeding Layer3 packets into this pipe. The choice of either L2TP or GRE depends on the application- whether you need to tunnel entire frames as they are sent by the source, or whether you just need to tunnel original packets without their link layer encapsulation. There is actually an exception to the rules above which may make things more confusing. You could also tunnel Layer2 frames across GRE tunnels as well. The trick is in knowing what kind of frame you have tunneled in a GRE packet. If you have a closer look at the format of the basic 4-byte GRE header, the first 2 bytes specify GRE version and flags, and the second 2 bytes have the same meaning as the EtherType field in Ethernet: They identify the payload type of the GRE packet. If there is a valid registered EtherType value for the frame you want to carry across a GRE tunnel then by all means, you can tunnel it. If there is no registered EtherType value then you're in trouble because you cannot just invent a value and put it there- the receiving endpoint may not understand the value, or it may mistake it for another protocol and process the encapsulated frame incorrectly. All common Layer3 protocols have their EtherType registered because they are intended to be carried in Ethernet frames, so with Layer3 packets, we usually don't have a problem. However, not all Layer2 protocols have their EtherTypes because tunneling frames inside other frames is not a common practice. Hence the nature of GRE as a predominantly Layer3-oriented tunneling protocol. Just for your convenience, you can find the available list of existing EtherType values at http://standards-oui.ieee.org/ethertype/eth.txt Neither L2TP nor GRE need IPsec per se. Both tunelling protocols will run happily without IPsec but then, of course, they will carry all data unencrypted and unprotected. IPsec is an add-on to both these protocols to provide security for the data transmission (authentication, confidentiality, integrity, replay attack protection). By saying that ""L2TP is also a dialer using PPP/PPPoE to connect to the ISP"" you probably mean the Virtual-PPP interface- am I right? Can you clarify this in more detail? 2) what is the difference beteween point-to-point protocol and point to point tunneling protocol? since they both support non-IP traffic PPP is a Layer2 protocol and is intended to be run directly over physical network interfaces. It is not a tunneling protocol, rather, it is a data link protocol originally created to be used on serial interfaces of computers and routers. It replaced or supplemented other serial link protocols such as SLIP or HDLC. In terms of OSI model placement, PPP is on the same layer as Ethernet- both run over physical network interfaces and define how two directly connected network interfaces send messages to each other. PPTP is a tunneling protocol that uses a modification of the GRE protocol and an additional signalling protocol to tunnel PPP frames in IP packets over a routed network. This is the confusing thing about PPTP- it uses GRE to tunnel PPP frames, and only PPP frames. You cannot carry other kinds of traffic over PPTP directly- it wasn't designed to work that way even though the GRE itself would be be capable of doing that. Instead, everything you want to carry over a PPTP tunnel has first to be put into PPP frames, and these will then get GRE-encapsulated and sent over the tunnel to the far end. The fact that PPP is used inside PPTP does not imply that PPP was invented with PPTP in mind. It's actually the other way around- PPP existed long before PPTP, and creators of PPTP felt that it would be beneficial to use it because it provides for some neat features they would otherwise need to reimplement (authentication, higher protocol negotiation, automatic IP configuration to name a few). The fact that PPP is used inside PPTP does not make PPP alone a tunneling protocol; rather, PPP is just a ""victim"" of PPTP. PPTP is not a data link layer protocol as it is not directly used over any kind of physical interface, quite the contrary: PPTP expects that basic IP connectivity (using any kind of of physical and data link layer) between the endpoints is already in place. 3) what about standalone PPTP (no GRE)? why do I want PPTP running inside a GRE? how do I benefit from this?also, why can`t I use PPTP with GRE and ipsec for security, or just PPTP with ipsec? why should I use L2TP? what is it`s benefits? PPTP consists internally of a somewhat modified GRE plus an additional control channel running over TCP that provides for the tunnel session setup and teardown. There is no such thing as a standalone PPTP without GRE: PPTP is GRE, even though not a vanilla GRE, rather an adapted version of it. Regarding the combination of PPTP and IPsec- technically, there is nothing that would prevent you from protecting a PPTP tunnel with IPsec. It's just a unicast IP traffic and every such traffic between two fixed endpoints can be protected by IPsec. If this combination is not available on a particular device or operating system it's just because this combination was never sufficiently strongly requested by customers to be implemented by vendors. L2TP has the advantage of being more feature-rich, more widely supported and actively developed, but it was really designed to be used in service provider environments where hundreds or thousands of individual subscribers and their traffic are tunneled between an access concentrator and a network server. These features are not used if the L2TP is terminated at a single user's PC or home router. Of course there's nothing wrong about it, it's just the L2TP is something of an overkill for such a small-scale deployment. Still, as it turned out, PPTP is considered to be simply obsolete and not developed or maintained anymore, and L2TP is universally suggested as one of the possible replacements. 4)who is the dialer in GRE+IPSEC tunnel (or GRE standalone tunnel?) what protocol is used? what layer 2 is used to establish the connection? I am not entirely sure what you mean by the ""dialer"". With GRE, the encapsulation is Tunnel IP header | GRE header | Original IP packet This entire packet is an IP packet, and is simply routed across the network to the tunnel endpoint, being L2-decapsulated and L2-encapsulated at each router according to normal rules. 5)when you say GRE uses protocol 47 and ipsec uses protocol 50 and/or 51 (esp/ah)- how do they both come together? how does an encapsulation look with both these protocols? what is used at each layer? Depending on whether IPsec is used in transport or tunnel mode, an IPsec-protected GRE packet looks like this: Tunnel mode: IPsec tunnel IP header | ESP/AH | GRE tunnel IP header | GRE header | Original IP packet Transport mode: GRE tunnel IP header | ESP/AH | GRE header | Original IP packet With IPsec protection, the outer header (the leftmost shown) will always use the Protocol value of 50/51. The Protocol value of 47 is retained in the GRE tunnel IP header (tunnel mode) or is moved to the Next Header field of the ESP/AH header (transport mode). 6)does LNS actually mean ""a L2TP server just insdie a router""? LNS means L2TP Network Server, and it can- but does not need to- mean that this functionality is implemented in a network router. LNS is a software service, and it can be either done in the operating system (and perhaps partially in hardware) of a router, or it can be run on a server. There are implementations of LNS functionality for Linux-based servers, for example. The terminology of LAC (L2TP Access Concentrator) and LNS (L2TP Network Server) is given by RFCs that specify L2TP operation. These RFCs do not mandate how or where these two elements are implemented. Any device that performs the tasks of LAC or LNS is called a LAC or a LNS, and whether it is a dedicated router or even a PC or a Raspberry Pi does not matter to L2TP. 7)if I come up with a GRE tunnel and ipsec, I still need to use L2TP as the dial-up at the client`s end, don`t I? Certainly not- GRE tunnels create IP packets, and these IP packets will be routed to the other tunnel endpoint across an existing IP connectivity. Before you can have a GRE tunnel between two endpoints, you must first have a working IP connectivity between them (this is the same as with PPTP; after all, PPTP is based on GRE). There is no need to use L2TP here. Even if you encapsulate the GRE into IPsec, you again get an IP packet that you can just send to the other tunnel endpoint, provided there already is a workable IP connectivity. Feel welcome to ask further! Best regards, Peter, Hello Peter, Thanks alot for joining in with a comprehensive and detailed replay, as usual. I`m afraid I did not explain myself well on the dialer issues (questions 1,4 and 7) so I`ll try to be more clear this time: when you try to set a VPN tunnel to the ISP you can do it in 3 ways (at least where I live): if it`s through the phone provider (i.e. copper-lines going to DSLAM and then to an NGN all-IP network) you will need to set up a PPPoe dialer, and once you needed a PPTP dialer. I`m talking about the client/windows dialer here. if your provider is the cable company (mpls) you can either dial up with PPTP or L2TP, both found on ms-windows of course, or you can use a direct link to their mpls network, which in this case requires no client dial-up software (always connected). what I get from this is that a layer 2 PPP is required for authentication, that is what enables the ISP to know who is trying to connect and to bill them accordingly. all of my dial question are referring to a client trying to establish a VPN tunnel to the ISP and hopefully to a remote access device. so an L2TP dialer would form a L2TP tunnel, but what will PPTP form? an regular unsecured GRE tunnel? if so, how is it considered a VPN? you said it is not common to see a PPTP tunnel with IPsec covering it, so when a client dials through a PPTP client-software- is IPsec only added at the ISP or already at the client`s end? since PPTP is end-to-end but unsecured AND is considered a VPN- where is it added? I think I got a little confused by the client-side, trying to establish a VPN to the ISP, and the provider-side which is what you learn when you practice this stuff: creating a GRE, IPsec encapsulation, transport/tunnel etc. in no place do you learn about PPTP dial-up (obsolete) and configuring an LNS and LAC devices is way beyond my scope, so I focus on the client-end- for now. can you explain a bit about those dialer from the client prespective? again, thanks alot... Willow, Hi Peter, Another thing, I was reading your replay and assumed the packet-structure examples you gave (question 5) refers to ""GRE over IPsec"". if so, how come in the ""transport mode"" the outer header is a GRE header? isn`t the routing done with an IPsec IP header in ""GRE over IPsec"" (as you showed in tunnel mode)? on the same note, can you please draw the structure of an "" IPsec over Gre "" packet same way you did to ""GRE over IPsec"", i.e. tunnel/transport modes? also, what is the point of using an AH-IPsec, if AH does not encrypt? what is the purpose of this tunnel? how is it different from a plain regular GRE tunnel? when should I use a tunnel that only authenticates? so many question... hope you`ll find the time for them:) thanks, Willow, Hi Willow, Okay, let's start;) First, though, let me ask you a question. You wrote: when you try to set a VPN tunnel to the ISP you can do it in 3 ways Why would you want to set up a VPN tunnel to the ISP? What kind of traffic would be tunneled across it? I am asking because usually, you want an ISP to provide you with basic (or native) internet (IP) connectivity. The VPN types we're discussing (PPTP, L2TP, GRE, IPsec) are add-ons to the basic connectivity, and you cannot have these VPN types without the basic connectivity. So if your ISP gives you this basic connectivity, there's no specific need to do additional tunneling unless you have some special need for that- and I am asking what that special need is supposed to be. if it`s through the phone provider (i.e. copper-lines going to DSLAM and then to an NGN all-IP network) you will need to set up a PPPoe dialer Customarily, we do not consider PPPoE to be a VPN. Of course it shares traits of a VPN as it involves tunneling PPP frames in Ethernet frames, but because the Ethernet part of this tunneling is outside the client's reach (with DSL routers, the Ethernet network isn't there anymore as they already have the DSL interface integrated), it merely becomes a mandatory- almost a legacy- part of all the overhead. So from the common client's point of view, there is no VPN to PPPoE because there is no ""native connectivity"" over the underlying Ethernet infrastructure- the Ethernet isn't anywhere in direct client's reach. and once you needed a PPTP dialer. This surprises me. PPTP assumes that the basic connectivity is already in place. PPTP cannot provide basic IP connectivity itself- on the contrary, it relies on it. So if you have a basic connectivity, what would you need PPTP toward your ISP for? if your provider is the cable company (mpls) you can either dial up with PPTP or L2TP Same as before. It is possible that I am not familiar with the way your providers offer internet connectivity, but of one thing I am certain: Both PPTP and L2TP need a working IP connectivity between your client software and the remote access server beforehand. Would that connectivity not suffice for accessing the internet? what I get from this is that a layer 2 PPP is required for authentication, that is what enables the ISP to know who is trying to connect and to bill them accordingly. Basically, yes. Providers have been accustomed to PPP since the times of old analog dialups and ISDNs, and when broadband technologies came in, PPP was just adapted to be used over them. This allowed providers to largely keep all the access, authentication and billing infrastructure unchanged- and compatible with different ways of client accessing the provider's network. so an L2TP dialer would form a L2TP tunnel, but what will PPTP form? an regular unsecured GRE tunnel? if so, how is it considered a VPN? L2TP will form an L2TP tunnel carrying either PPP or Ethernet frames (these are the most common frame types carried over L2TP). PPTP will form a GRE tunnel carrying PPP frames. Both L2TP and PPTP are unsecured tunnels and they would need IPsec for their protection. A VPN does not necessarily include encryption. That is an added quality but not a prerequisite. VPN is a generic name for a network that, from your viewpoint, operates as a dedicated network just for you and no one else, while in reality, it runs over a shared infrastructure. Even an Ethernet VLAN is a form of VPN. There are several categories of VPNs but from the security standpoint, there are two major categories: Secure VPNs and Trusted VPNs. Secure VPNs are all those technologies that employ encryption mechanisms (IPsec, SSL,...). Trusted VPNs are those technologies where, by the nature of how the VPNs operate, your data cannot leak out, and you trust your provider of this technology that he won't misconfigure things or sniff your data illegally (MPLS VPNs, Frame Relay PVCs,...). you said it is not common to see a PPTP tunnel with IPsec covering it, so when a client dials through a PPTP client-software- is IPsec only added at the ISP or already at the client`s end? since PPTP is end-to-end but unsecured AND is considered a VPN- where is it added? Nowhere. PPTP is an unsecured VPN. It was commonly used to access internal company networks by a home teleworker or a travelling employee, but it was not encrypted. That does not prevent it from being classified as a VPN- it's just not a secure VPN. That's one of the reasons it is now completely replaced by different technologies. If you think that having an unencrypted VPN is something unimaginable, think again:) Telnet, POP3, IMAP, HTTP, FTP, SNMPv1/v2...- all these protocols and more are unencrypted and carry all information, including passwords and sensitive data, unprotected. IP protocols were originally designed with a belief that the network user (or an administrator) is not malicious:) I think I got a little confused by the client-side, trying to establish a VPN to the ISP Well, to simplify it, out of all technologies you have been asking about, you're only using PPPoE for accessing the ISP and gaining access to internet. You do not ordinarily use PPTP or L2TP to access the internet; instead, you use PPTP or L2TP to access some private network across the existing internet connection. You are usually not creating a VPN to your ISP; you are creating a VPN across your ISP to some other location that is accessible through your ISP. I was reading your replay and assumed the packet-structure examples you gave (question 5) refers to ""GRE over IPsec"". if so, how come in the ""transport mode"" the outer header is a GRE header? isn`t the routing done with an IPsec IP header in ""GRE over IPsec"" (as you showed in tunnel mode)? That is because the IPsec transport mode maintains the original IP header along with all original addressing and stuff. The only thing that is changed is the Protocol field that obviously needs to be rewritten to indicate the presence of the AH/ESP. IPsec transport mode implicitly assumes that a direct connectivity already exists between the communicating stations that want to protect their communication by IPsec, so there is no reason to add another IP header with some other addresses. In other words, if the end hosts whose traffic is being IPsec-protected are also the IPsec tunnel endpoints then they can use IPsec transport mode. Otherwise, if the traffic between two end hosts is IPsec-encrypted and decrypted by other devices on the path (such as home routers), IPsec will need to run in tunnel mode. on the same note, can you please draw the structure of an "" IPsec over Gre "" packet same way you did to ""GRE over IPsec"", i.e. tunnel/transport modes? This order of encapsulation is used extremely rarely, mostly because there is no reason to add a GRE encapsulation onto an IPsec-protected packet that is itself fully capable of being routed across the network. I can draw the structure of such packets but it's more of an academic exercise, as you won't be seeing such packets out in the wild. IPsec over GRE, Tunnel mode: GRE tunnel IP header | GRE header | IPsec tunnel IP header | ESP/AH | Original IP packet IPsec over GRE, Transport mode: GRE tunnel IP header | GRE header | Original IP header | ESP/AH | Original IP packet's payload also, what is the point of using an AH-IPsec, if AH does not encrypt? what is the purpose of this tunnel? how is it different from a plain regular GRE tunnel? when should I use a tunnel that only authenticates? Originally, perhaps in the good Unix way of having a tool do just one thing but do it perfectly, IPsec had split the problem of comprehensive data transmission security into different protocols, each taking care of just a selected aspect of security. To provide for confidentiality, IPsec used ESP. To provide for integrity and anti-replay, IPsec used AH. If you wanted to implement just a part of these security aspects, you used only the corresponding protocol. If you wanted all of it, you used both ESP and AH at the same time. The authentication and anti-replay in AH make sure that the protected packets are received exactly as they have been sent- that is, no one has modified their contents, no one has spoofed these packets in the name of the original sender, and no one has captured these packets and re-sent them repeatedly to cause some action to be repeated. In other words, AH protects the integrity and un-repeatibility of these packets including their outer headers. Obviously, just as you are asking, the added value of AH protection alone was rather small. With AH, there was a guarantee that the packets have not been modified, spoofed or repeated while in transit, but their contents were still unprotected and readable by anyone having access to the transmission path. In addition, while the AH protection also covered the outer packet's header contents which could be perceived a good thing, this made AH immediately incompatible with NAT boxes that by definition modify the outer header's address fields. So as time passed, ESP was extended with the ability to not only provide for confidentiality but also for data integrity and anti-replay, and AH became obsolete. Nowadays, Cisco ASA firewalls do not even support AH (I am not sure if they ever supported it). Simply put, AH was a design choice that once appeared to be sensible but turned out otherwise. Best regards, Peter, Hi Peter, Completely understood, after this excellent explanation (as usual...) can`t thank you enough. I would only like to ask about what you said- that there is no need for additional tunneling after the IP is set between the customer and the ISP. my question is: why not? can`t the provider offer you a safe VPN (encrypted) tunnel to his end point, as a default service, so you can be sure that at least theconnectivity between you and him is secure? how the ISP runs it`s traffic afterwards is beyond your reach, but a safe VPN ipsec tunnel to the ISP seems logical, isn`t it? and if it is not so, why our cable provider offers two methods of connectivity: one directly to his mpls infrastructure which is ""always connected"" (no dial-up and dialers needed) and one is using L2TP and has to be activated each time you want to connect to the internet (i.e.- a dialer). if there is no need for a VPN tunnel to this provider (as you said, because there is already an IP connectivity)- then why does he offer this ""dial-up"" scheme? Peter, I would like to take this opportunity and say that I really appreciate the time and effort you put in those elaborated answers, you have helped me alot at my studies and there is nothing I can say that will emphasize this enough. bless you. Willow, Hi Peter, Well, I did some searching around and it seems the only place on this planet where you need an PPTP/L2TP connection to your ISP is in Israel and Ukraine. this is when you are on a cable infrastructure, and only for low speeds (30mps or less). why is that so? what exactly is going on with that sort of connection? is it a vpn tunnel from me to the isp? does that mean that EVERYTHING i do online is encrypted? seems pretty odd. I read somewhere that this method is provided when the ISP uses ""a local network"" in something that is called ""a dual access"". have you ever heard of this method? can you explain what it is and why is it used? (high speed connect directly to the mpls cable infrastructure). why do you need a vpn client software (a dialer like l2tp) to reach your isp? why would an isp use such a method? what good does it do? here are some quotes i read online, maybe they would help me explain myself.... image_022.png-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- image_023.png------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- btw, these questions are regarding to our conversation from before: image_024.png Thanks, Willow, Hi Willow, I apologize for answering late- I hope you are still tuned in to this thread. it seems the only place on this planet where you need an PPTP/L2TP connection to your ISP is in Israel and Ukraine. this is when you are on a cable infrastructure, and only for low speeds (30mps or less). why is that so? To be honest, I am at a loss. The only reason I can think of is that the cable service provider does not provide plain internet connectivity within its network itself, just provides an IP connectivity from customers to some device (let's call it access gateway) that can terminate tunnels and forward them to internet. So the net result would be that although the service provider can be IP-based and interconnect its customers using IP, this IP connectivity within the service provider's network is local to the service provider only. There is no direct access to internet from this network. Only those customers who got an extra account at the access gateway can get internet connectivity. Oh, and by the way, I was wrong regarding PPTP tunnels being unencrypted. Microsoft has its own encryption in PPP that is compounded with compression- perhaps you've heard about MPPC (Microsoft Point-to-Point Compression) and MPPE (Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption). This compression and encryption is negotiated in PPP similarly to packet payload compression. So in fact, PPTP tunnels are- or can be- encrypted if MPPC+MPPE is being used, and this is encryption on PPP level. Perhaps that's the reason why IPsec is not used along with PPTP+MPPE because it would be superfluous. Would this make any sense? Best regards, Peter, Hi Peter, You are very much correct. when using this vpn method, the provider supply you with a 172.20 IP address, which is theprovider`s local-inner network, and according to your destination request forward you to the internet or leaves you inside his local network if you just need access to local servers (like local forums or news etc.) Peter, I want to know another thing: why can`t one use a vpn with a proxy together? aside the issue that it does not add no your safety (you are only safe as your weakest link in the chain) I would really want to understand the reason behind this. why can`t I connect to a remote VPN server and create a safe tunnel between us, and than, after this is done, connect from that VPN server to a proxy? say you are using some service like ""cyber-ghost"" to connect to a vpn, and than you try to use ""hola"" to connect to a proxy- you will not be able to do it. if you try to configure a proxy address by yourself it won`t work as well. everyone says something different about this issue, so your opinion would be very appreciated as a tie-breaker:) on another note, I am happy to tell you I passed my ccna with almost the highest score possible- no dumps in the process, just pure knowledge- and a-lot of it is thanks to you! getting prepared to my ccnp these days... thank you very much for all your help along this journey!

issue with the Cisco anyconnect. Once clients are connnected they can't access anything, including their default gateway. VPN client pool is in the same subnet than local network (139.16.1.x/24). Local network clients can access to DMZ, VPN clients can ping local network computers but they can't access to DMZ. I guess any rule alowing this traffic is missing but IÂ´m new with Cisco ASA and IÂ´m totally lost. I have read as much as I could about this but I can't understand which rule is needed. Many many thanks in advance for your support.

You can look into those if they fit in your criteria. Regards Jagmeet, Ashok Jagmeet has identified your best alternatives, either an ASA or a router. Either of those might work well for you. My personal preference is that for site to site VPN the router solution gives you a bit more flexibility in how to set up the site to site VPN. HTH Rick, Hi Jagmeet, Will I have to worry about licensing if use 5505 or 5506 for Site to site always on IPsec VPN? Richard, I will check on licensing on 2901. I also have an 1801 router and will check that too. Thanks, Ashok, ASA 5505 can only handle a maximum of 25 VPN sessions. 5506 can handle up to 50, but you need the SecurityPlus license., Thanks. Ashok, I agree with Rick that a router is much more flexible. On the ASA you have the traditional/unflexible crypto-maps and... well that's all. On the router you can integrate your routing into the VPN much easier through the use of different kind of tunnel-interfaces. In my designs, I alwaysplace routers for site to site when there are more than a handful of sites. With low-end-routers already in place at the branches this flexibility doesn't help you much. But when these devices have to be replaced sooner or later, you'll have a much more powerfull VPN., Hi, I started looking right after Jagmeet's post and found that ASA's will definitely do the job. Thanks Jagmeet for your thoughts. On this the questionI have is, which model i.e. 505 or 506...or [the customer doesn't care if that is nor supported any more- they told me that they can buy 2 if needed and if one goes down (no issues with the down time)- the other one can be brought on line to replace that]. They want the least expensive. Sorry- I have to work with this constraint. On the router option (thanks Richard and Karsten), I am intrigued (especiallysomethe points you listed as a plus points over ASA). Theyalready have a 2901 (with 2 built in Gb ports 0/0 & 0/1 and additional 4 port card), so is this an option for my needs? Will look forward to your thoughts. Thanks, Ashok, Ashok A 2901 will certainly do site to site IPsec tunnels assuming that it has the correct license/feature set. It would need the security license. If the customer is looking for the lowest cost solution it would certainly be cheaper to purchase the security license (if they do not already have it) than to purchase a new device. If you are going to add 20 to 30 site to site IPsec tunnels for the router you might evaluate how much load is already on the router and what impact 30 tunnels might have on it.

You would do much better to use Dead Peer Detection which uses whether it receives responses to ISAKMP as the measure of when a peer is not working. HTH Rick, Hi Rick, I agree wholeheartedly. I've honestly not had much luck with ASA's and redundancy using SLA; It always seems to try and bring the backup tunnel online when there is no legitimate failure on the primary and I end up needing to rip out the redundant configs and just rebuild it manually during a failure; Not efficient. I did not know there was another method of handling this but now that I do, I will certainly give DPD a good look. Aquestion if I may: I see on the DPD article on Cisco's site that you can configure ""one-way"" DPD mode when your device is an ASA. Would you recommend I use this mode on my branch 5505's? In my head the way I see this working is below. Can you confirm if I am on the right track? 1) Branch ASA 5505 sends ""R-U-THERE"" message to primary data center peer every X seconds, and will repeat up to 3 transmissions. 2) After the 3rd failed retransmission, the branch 5505 will tear down the primary peer and build the backup peer. 3) Since I am running EIGRP in the data center, and static routing at the branch, when the primary data center ASA detects failure in it's path and can no longer reach the remote sites, EIGRP will look for an alternate path to the branches. The only other path would be via the other data center circuit. Will that circuit determine it has a valid route to the branch based on it's ability to connect to the public address it peers with the branch to?Additionally, do I need to use HSRP on my two data center circuits to make this work correctly, or is EIGRP/DUAL enough to control it? 4) At this point, let's say the circuit is restored. How will the branch 5505 know that it is time to flip back to primary? Diego, Thanks you for that input as well. I will be reading the link you sent over to me about the timers tonight., I am not familiar with the one way DPD and so can not offer much advice about it. It seems that it could achieve what you need in terms of allowing the Branch ASA to detect a failure of the primary and to bring up the second peer. It is not clear how you have configured EIGRP. How is EIGRP at the head end learning the routes for the Remote and how would EIGRP detect the failure and withdraw the remote route in the event of a failure? I have had a couple of customers who did use EIGRP over site to site VPN and would have EIGRP detect the failure and direct traffic over the backup connection. But this was on IOS routers and not on ASA, and both tunnels were up all of the time and EIGRP was running over the tunnels. That is certainly quite different from what you need to do if the remote is just using static routes. It is my assumption that the Remote will continue to try to send ISAKMP after there has been a failure of the connection to the primary and if the primary starts to respond again then the Remote will switch the VPN back to the primary. But that is my understanding and not based on actual experience. HTH Rick, Hi Rick, My apologies. Currently, the data center is using a static route to get to each branch, and there are 142 of them. The static routes to get back to the branches from the data center either point to the ASA connected to ISP 1 or the ASA connected to ISP 2. However, I don't like that because50% of my sites have their VPN's built to the ASA connected to data center ISP 1 and the other 50% of my sites have their VPN's built to the ASA connected to data center ISP 2. There is nothing dynamic or redundant about my set up currently, even though there are two circuits, if 1 of them fails, half of the company is down. I want to fix that by essentially making all of my sites connect to the ASA connected to data center ISP 1, and only connect to data center ISP 2 if ISP 1 circuit at the data center is down. However, on the data center side, unless I configure 142 IP SLA's and use route tracking to switch the static route over the backup if the sites are no longer visible from data center ISP circuit 1, I am thinking I will need to use dynamic routing. So my thought was to run EIGRP at the data center for the local networks, and redistribute the static routes from the branches.  Of course now that I type that out, I'm not sure that would work. I think I would need to run EIGRP at the branches so the data center knows about the LAN's. Otherwise it would never know how to get to the branch LAN's unless I added the static routes back into EIGRP on the core and redistributed them, which defeats the purpose of having dynamic circuit/path failover., Thanks for the additional explanation. It does help clarify your environment. Running EIGRP out to the remote would be an attractive option but I am not sure that it is supported on the ASA. I have run EIGRP out to remote peers when using IOS routers (using both GRE with IPsec tunnels and using VTI tunnels) and it was very effective. But on the ASA I believe that you need to look for a different alternative. It seems to me that using Reverse Route Injection as part of your site to site VPN ought to work. With RRI the ASA inserts a static route for the remote resources when the VPN tunnel is negotiated and traffic can flow. If you redistribute the statics into EIGRP then EIGRP should be learning the routes from whichever ASA has the currently active tunnel. And that should provide the dynamic failover that you need. HTH Rick, Hi Diego and Rick, Sorry for the delay in replying back to you.  For Diego's default route tracking at the data center instead of the 142 static routes idea; Currently there is a 3rd firewall in the mix, which holds all of the services for non-VPN outside internet users when they come in from the public internet and use our company resources in the DMZ. It is also the firewall that ultimately gives internet access to the branches, as we centralize internet access for all 142 sites to come from the data center ISP 1 150Mbps circuit after they arrive here from the VPN.This 3rd firewallshares the same ISP circuit # 1 as the VPN hub firewall. ISP circuit 2 is connected only to the other VPN-hub firewall. I've amended the drawing to reflect this in the attachment. I didn't think I needed to include it as it is not currently related to the VPN hubs, but now there is value in mentioning it. So the challenge I see in doing two default routes and route tracking them, is that currently the 142 static routes on the 6509 core switch tell the data center which hub to point to for getting back to the branch, and the default route on the 6509 is currently pointing to that 3rd firewall facing the public internet, and is how the branches ultimately get to the internet, and how outside non-VPN'd users connect to our DMZ services. I know you're probably thinking that it doesn't make much sense to have dynamic VPN-hub redundancy with only 1 path out to thepublic internet for the branches to pull internet access from, and I would agree (working on fixing that next), but for now they can at least use company resources in the event ISP 1 was down. Anyway, doing default route tracking between the two VPN hubs would mean I need to remove the default route to that 3rd firewall on the 6509. And since that 3rd firewall is where everyone has to pass through to get centralized internet and non-VPN users to use DMZ resources, I think it has to be a default route because I can't do a static route for every subnet on the internet. The next thought I had when considering this idea is why not just roll the 3rd firewall's services into the VPN hubs and eliminate the 3rd firewall? That way I could do the default route tracking and everything would be great. However (and please correct me if I am wrong), I think I will run into problems in that case since the internet service is centralized, and if I remove the 3rd firewall and make ultimate internet services come from the same firewall that the VPN tunnels come in on, won't I have to hairpin (i.e. spin it around and shoot it right back out as soon as I receive it from the tunnel) allbranch trafficreceivedon that ASA destined for the internet once it comes in from the tunnel as opposed to following a forward-progressing/linear path (i.e. VPN5520--6509---INET5520---internet as opposed to VPN5520 inbound----VPN5520 outbound---internet)? If so, then the other challenge currently is that all internet bound traffic from branches must first hit our webfilter connected to the 6509 before going out to the internet. So if I were to consolidate the 3rd firewall's services into the VPN-1 firewall, I would need a way to ensure that internet bound traffic will go to the 6509 before going back out the VPN-1 hub to get to the public internet. Rick, I believe the 5505's do support EIGRP actually. Here is some output options from one of my branch 5505's: FW59Dallas-CBL5505# show ver | inc asa System image file is ""disk0:/asa825-k8.bin"" FW59Dallas-CBL5505# config t FW59Dallas-CBL5505(config)# router? configure mode commands/options: eigrp Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) ospf Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) rip Routing Information Protocol (RIP) That said, if Diego's comments are correct regarding that site to site VPN's can't propagate protocols, then we probably can't use it. I am actually not familiar with RRI. Let me go ahead and read up on that. Would it be implement on branch side, core side, or both? Attachment: reundancy_example.jpg, I see RRI as being useful at the hub but not so much at the branch. At the hub you need to know where the branch is connected and I believe that RRI could achieve that. At the branch all traffic comes to your network edge device and it knows to send traffic to one peer or the other. So I do not see much benefit for RRI at the branch. The logic from Diego depends on this ""now is going to be all branches on ISP1 or all branches on ISP2"". As I read your description I wonder if that is the case. Is it possible that most branches will be using ISP1 but that a branch or two might have experienced an issue with ISP1 and have failed over to ISP2? If that is possible then removing the individual routes and using just default routes with tracking seems to be problematic. Perhaps you can clarify how you see this working? HTH Rick, Hi Rick, I actually hadn't considered pathing problems for a few sites having an issue with ISP 1 and needing to be switched over. We've definitely had sites have that problem in the past and moving them to ISP 2 has resolved the issues. So Yeah, I think I definitely need to not do an ""All branches on ISP 1 unless ISP 1 completely fails"" scenario. I supposed I could just configure 142 IP SLA's on the core switch but that is so messy. For the RRI idea, so basically in the tunnel configs on the hub side I would do: crypto map outside_map 1 match address outside_cryptomap_1 crypto map outside_map 1 set pfs group5 crypto map outside_map 1 set peer 3.3.3.1 crypto map outside_map 1 set transform-set ESP-AES-256-SHA crypto map outside_map 1 set reverse-route But on the branch side of the VPN tunnel I do not need to set that bold command in the crypto map configs? I had thought the crypto maps had to match exactly on both ends aside from the obvious ACL names and peer IP address for the tunnel to work? I also see in this guide that they use a route-map that is calling a prefix-list which contains all of the branch subnets that they are using in the redistribute static command. Is that mandatory, or can I just do ""redistribute static"" and not call a route map? It also says you need default-information originate in the core ASA under the routing process you are using or the ASA won't send out any networks., First let me address something from a previous post. I had talked about running EIGRP out to the remote and said that it was not supported on the ASA. I realize now that this was a bit ambiguous. You interpreted it as believing that EIGRP was not supported. And clearly EIGRP is supported on ASA (assuming reasonably recent code version). What I was trying to say was that running EIGRP over the IPsec tunnel out to the remote is not supported. 142 IP SLAs would be very messy and I believe that RRI is likely to achieve what you want. Let me be clear that I have not used RRI and so I speak from what the documentation says and not from experience. We do frequently say that the crypto maps must be exact matches on both ends. And for a number of things, such as the content of the access list that identifies traffic to be encrypted, whether to use PFS or not and the PFS group, the type of encryption it is true that they must match. But for RRI I do not believe that they need to match. Using a route map with a prefix list might be considered as a Best Practice. But it is certainly not required. It is very useful when there are some static routes that you do want to redistribute and some static routes that you do not want to redistribute. I know some people who routinely use a route map to control redistribution to prevent the possibility that at some later time someone would add a static route whose redistribution might create problems. They want to control redistribution and to be very intentional about what is redistributed. I do not know your environment and so do not know if there are static routes on your hub ASA in addition to the static routes for the branch routes. Are there static default routes on the ASA and if so what would be the impact of redistributing those static default routes into EIGRP? I am not clear what they said about needing default information originate or the context in which they said it. If you already are running EIGRP on the core ASA do you have default information originate configured? Is the ASA advertising routes? HTH Rick, Hi Rick, Noted and understood regarding EIGRP on the 5505's, thanks for the additional explanation on that. I can see why route-maps would certainly be the best way to go. That said, I'm the only network engineer on staff, so for the most part no one else has access, but I am certainly an advocate of doing things in best practice, so I will configure a route map.  We actually already run EIGRP in the core, but only for local subnets within the data center building, and only between core switch and 3rd internet ASA. The routes to the branches are still via the 142 static routes. We are redistributing static on the EIGRP process on the core SW currently so that the 3rd internet-facing ASA that supplies the branches with internet knows about the 142 VPN routes set on the core, so I guess I would say testing that part out already works and doesn't step on anything it shouldn't. I just checked the 3rd ASA and it is learning everything via D EX, so we are good there. As for default-information-originate, it is not currently configured under my EIGRP process on the core switch. Below is a link to the RRI guide I used which specifiesthis step being required. One big difference however, is that he used OSPF while I use EIGRP. http://www.petenetlive.com/KB/Article/0000982 Section snippet from article is below: 6. And finally, remember the ASA wont send out any networks, without a default-information originate command. Main-GW(config-router)# redistribute static subnets route-map RM-VPN-ROUTES Main-GW(config-router)# default-information originate, It certainly is an important distinction that the article was dealing with OSPF. And I would argue that the article over stated the importance of default-information originate. It is important if you want OSPF to advertise a default route. I do not believe that it is required if you want OSPF to advertise redistributed routes but not necessarily a default route. HTH Rick, Hi Rick, Thanks for checking into that for me. Actually, now that I think about it, in my situation, I think default-information originate would be counter-intuitive in my dual VPN hub setup If I were to set default-information originate on my ASA VPN hubs 1 & 2, then redistribute static into EIGRP,my core switch is going to learn the default routes of both ASA VPN hubs via D EX. But I don't think my core switch much cares what each ASA's default route is, nor is it require to see it. It only cares which ASA it is currently learning the routes to the branches from at any given time.  Am I on the right track with that train of thought?, I believe that you are indeed on the right train of thought. If I understand your environment correctly then your core switch does need to have its default route point toward your third ASA. It would seem to be a significant negative if your core switch were to try to use a default route that pointed to one of the ASAs that terminate VPNs from the remote sites. HTH Rick, Excellent. Thanks so much for your help on this one Rick. I really appreciate it., You are quite welcome. When you do get it implemented please do post back to the forum and let us know what you wind up with and how it worked. HTH Rick, Will do, thanks.  One final follow up; I presented this solution to my manager this morning and he likes it, but he wants to wait until we swap out the data center 5520's with Next Gen 5525-X's. I am going to read up on it, but is there anything you know of that will change any part of this solution if the data center firewall becomes a next gen unit while the branch stays old gen 5505?, I am not aware of any aspect of this solution that would be impacted or would work any different if the data center ASAs were upgraded to 5525s from 5520s. Certainly there are differences between 5520 and 5525 including more memory, more powerful processor, greater throughput, more features (such as FirePower). But as far as I know the functionality for site to site VPN, for routing EIGRP, and for RRI should remain the same and I would certainly expect no problem with operability between 5505 and 5525. If the intent to wait to implement until the ASA are upgraded is based on management considerations (prioritization of Network Engineering resources, etc) then it is fine to wait. But if it reflects any concern about functionality of the ASAs then I see no reason to wait. HTH Rick, Thanks Rick. Much appreciated as always., Hello, What I understand is that you have 142 routes because you ' re doing ""load balancing"" between your two ISPs but now that you will have all your branches connected to a single ISP at the time you don ' t need to announce branch xxxx on ISP1 or branch yyyy on ISP2 you dont need all these static routes, now is going to be all branches on ISP1 or all branches on ISP2 so you just need to track the default gateway to ISP1 andthe interesting traffic defined in the crypto maps will sendthe trafficto the correct peer ""branch"". I would say that in this particular setup that you are trying to accomplish you donÂ´t need 142 routes or dynamic routing you just need 2 default gateway one pointing to ISP1 and the other to ISP2 on the router and use SLA to track the primary route, that will do the trick:-). I also want to clarify that a site to site vpn tunnel cant propagate dynamic protocols is one of its limitations in this case likeRichard said GRE tunnels ""on routers"" can propagate this protocols because they have the ability to send multicast over a unicast., Hello, You can configure keepalives in the branch office ASA, so it can monitor the peer and in case the peer goes down it will drop the tunnel, since you configured a backup ip in the crypto map "" crypto map outside_map 1 set peer12.x.xxx.20  50.xxx.xx.190  "" it will try to reestablish the tunnel with the backup IP. The SLA in the Data Center should bring the primary gateway backup once is operational and the ASA will switch back to the primary when the keepalives are not replied from the secondary peer.

What sort of device do you have? IOS Router? ASA? Do you need access to everything, or just one IP address (one IP address is easier, and you could use a server as a jump host). And to beg the question, any chance one of you could change your IP address range? Much simpler., Hi Philip, I am using an IOS router. Client can't do Nat they have other customers connecting to Sonic Forewall.  There are two clients hosts we need to get to 10.91.1.40 and 10.91.1.60. These addresses are not conflicting so I can route them as /32 on our network to VPN router.  In this case guess I don't have to NaT but just use static host to host mapping. But if I choose to NAT on just my router hosts from 10.134.206.1 to 192.168.156.6 is it not possible?  I want the configuration to be secure as possible. i have attached config and diagram so would like to know best way to do this. It would be nice to hide our 10 network from client.  I am not sure if I have made a mistake in configuration I am not see traffic or tunnel coming up at all.  My host 10.134.206.1 is a VM host in the Data Center. I have added /32 route for 10.91.1.40 and.60 to go via 10.134.246.253 router., Does the client need to connect to your IP addresses at all? It sounds like no. In which case, NAT all of your internal traffic to yourpublic IP address (which you will already be doing to access the Internet). Your source of the VPN will then be this public IP address. That solves the main problem. You can then do destination NAT if you like on the customer IP addresses., Hi Philip, The traffic is only one way from us to them. Mostly RDP and sharing drives. Not done this before do you have sample config or point me to one please?, This is an example of using ""ip nat outside"". http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/13773-2.html, Hi Philip, Ok I will try again.

29,29,islow1303,"[user1, asker, user2]","[Generally speaking, yes. Practically, it depends on what software version and type of VPN are you using on the 5505. IPsec site-site or remote access VPN- copies over mostly as-is. The related ACLs and NAT syntax will be different if the 5505 is running 8.2(x) or earlier software. SSL Remote access VPN (client-based or clientless)- copies over as-is with the note that you need the AnyConnect licensing on the ASA 5585. It does not transfer and is not transferable (unless you had already upgraded to AnyConnect 4.x licensing on the 5505)- must be purchased. If it's EzVPN, the 5585-X does not support that., I have assumed so- it's IPsec site-site... that has technically answered my question. Thanks Mr. Rhoads, One more thing to add: Make sure your VPN-config includes the PSKs.

30,30,cwhlaw2009,[user1],"[Hello! ASA5512 can hold up to 250 simultaneous VPNs of any type: IPsec Site-to-Site or IPsec Remote access, or Anyconnect VPNs using SSL or IPsec IKEv2, or even Clientless VPNs. That means, that you can use 2 Anyconnect premium + 248 IPSEC Site-to-Site VPNs. Or, for example, 200 simultaneous IPsec Site-to-Site VPNs + 25 VPN Client (IPsec IKEv1) + 25 AnyConnect VPNs (SSL or IPsec IKE v2). But no more then 250 at the same time. ""AnyConnect for Mobile"" is currently out-of-date license. The license schema for Anyconnect was changed dramatically at the beginning of 2015. You can check the new schema here: http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/security/anyconnect-og.pdf With new schema, if you need to connect mobile devices (iOS, Android and so on), using Anyconnect client, you just need to have Anyconnect PLUS license for neccessary amount of users/devices. Anyconnect Plus license will open following lines in the output of show version: AnyConnect Premium Peers: 250 perpetual AnyConnect for Mobile: Enabled perpetual AnyConnect for Cisco VPN Phone: Enabled perpetual Advanced Endpoint Assessment: Enabled perpetual But, in spite of the output "" AnyConnect Premium Peers: 250 perpetual "", you will have the right to use not more then ordered amount... If you need some advanced features, for example,Suite B Cryptography or Clientless VPNs, you need to order Anyconnect Apex licensefor neccessary amount of users/devices. For ASA5512 you need to order Anyconnect Plus or Apex licenses, but no more then for 250 users, because ASA5512 won't support more then 250 simultaneous connections. If you want to use Anyconnect client for mobile devices, and you are going to use IPsec IKEv2 for VPNs, you also will need to order Anyconnect Plus or Apex licenses.

Your config is very similar to mine. I don't have this line: anyconnect profiles ikev2-anyconnect_client_profile disk0:/ikev2-anyconnect_client_profile.xml I also have a newer version of AnyConnect deployed: anyconnect image disk0:/anyconnect-win-4.1.06020-k9.pkg 1 regex ""Windows NT"" I have found the clients *.XML profile can be a bit touchy. Below is a sample XML profile that I use: &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> &lt;AnyConnectProfile xmlns=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/encoding/"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:schemaLocation=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/encoding/AnyConnectProfile. xsd""> &lt;ServerList> &lt;HostEntry> &lt;HostName>""customer name""&lt;/HostName> &lt;HostAddress>""DNS name of device- must match certificate""&lt;/HostAddress> &lt;UserGroup>""group name""&lt;/UserGroup> &lt;PrimaryProtocol>IPsec&lt;/PrimaryProtocol> &lt;/HostEntry> &lt;/ServerList> &lt;/AnyConnectProfile>, I notice in that link you supplied their XML profile doesn't have the UserGroup attribute. We have multiple groups configured on our ASA. Perhaps it is only needed if you have more than one (or perhaps it only uses the default group). And from your post your ASA also sounds like it has multiple groups., Thanks for the information Philip. I am not sure I know what you mean by user group. All we have is one database of users and it's the local database. The XML profile that is installed on the ASA was automatically created by the asa when I set this up using the remote access wizard in the ASDM. I adjusted the xml file earlier today but it was incorrect, I thought the ""hostname"" was supposed to be the dns name. I changed that and the ""host address"" but it's still giving me the same error., From the above config, you group is anyconnect-ikev2., I have fixed the problem. It was with the xml profile. I had to import it into the ""Profile"" folder on my local PC. I did this yesterday but I don't think the xml profile was configured correctly. Here is the path to put it in the correct folder on a windows 7 machine: %PROGRAMDATA%\Cisco\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\Profile The link I pasted in my original comment has that information. After I pasted it in I changed the XML profile to look like this: &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> &lt;AnyConnectProfile xmlns="" http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/encoding/ "">  &lt;ServerList>  &lt;HostEntry>  &lt;HostName>vpn.customer.com&lt;/HostName>  &lt;HostAddress>vpn.customer.com&lt;/HostAddress>  &lt;PrimaryProtocol>IPsec&lt;/PrimaryProtocol>  &lt;/HostEntry>  &lt;/ServerList> &lt;/AnyConnectProfile> It works if I put the IP address in for the &lt;HostAddress> section but then I get a certificate error since the dns lookup is being done by the host file on my local machine. I am not a fan of this as each person who is going to connect in this manner will have to put that xml file in the profile folder. According to the link I was working with, it will automatically install the xml profile in the profile folder if they use the web deployment, I was unable to test this out though as I am getting a JAVA error when trying that method. Either way, the issue is resolved. Thanks for you help Philip!, You're welcome.

If they are currently running AC3.x and they have the Premium license for AC3.x then what is the requirement to go to APEX? I would assume that installing APEX would not impact the current AC3.x which should continue to run with its Premium license. If they are planning to upgrade AC to 4.x then is when they will need APEX. HTH Rick, Hi Rick, Premium licencing isEoS as of last year so they need to migrate to APEX to increase licence count. Like you I cannot see how changing the activation key on an ASA would affect connectivity for 3.x, butstruggling to find anything documented to support APEX licencing compatibility with AC v3.x. I am pretty certain I have read somewhere that when you activate the new APEX key it shows as premium in a show ver. Thanks Andy, I have no documentation at my fingertip, but using AC3 with AC4 PLUS or APEX licenses is technically supported and fully compliant from a licensing perspective., Thanks for the reply Karsten., Yes- applying an AnyConnect Apex activation key will make the ASA show the Premium license count (as well as Advanced Endpoint Assessment and AnyConnect for Mobile which used to be separately licensed features). You can continue to use the AC 3.x image as your client image but you're encouraged to migrate to 4.x since 3.x development will not be moving forward after this spring (2016). Reference: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/anyconnect-sec...

The link shows how to configure split tunneling when using the old IPsec VPN client. In today's environment why suggest a product that is EOL and EOS. Why would we suggest a Remote Access VPN solution different from AnyConnect? Additionally this example shows only Remote Access VPN and does not show coexistence of Remote Access VPN with Site to Site VPN. HTH Rick, Hello Richard, When people talk about remote access VPN is most likely referring to the VPN client and this user is requesting configuration example not client advice. If the user could confirm what he was looking for would be great. The configuration here is not illustrating site to site tunnel coexisting with remote access vpn but I can confirm that it works because I have done it and works with no problems, the ipsec client works with the dynamic crypto map and if you have static maps on top of that one they can operate with no issues. I understand that the VPN client is out of sale and support but not all the users will have the option to purchase an SSL license to enable Anyconnect that's another thing to consider when recommending Anyconnect.]",[2],1,2016-01-07,12743166,0,8,i want to configure remote access vpn on my production level router on which we setup p2p ipsec vpn. please guide me can i do this on same router with existing policy/ike. would love if get any working example cause i have't much time... thanks vpn  remote easyvpn,[],1841,VPN,https://supportforums.cisco.com/discussion/12743166/1841,5373666,6.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,1841 i want to configure remote access vpn on my production level router on which we setup p2p ipsec vpn. please guide me can i do this on same router with existing policy/ike. would love if get any working example cause i have't much time... thanks vpn  remote easyvpn,want configure remote access vpn production level router setup p2p ipsec vpn please guide router existing would love get working example cause much time thanks vpn remote

Because In my lab I didn't create any permit access-list meanwhile inside network can access telnet, www, etc, to DMZ but ping is not allowed. 2. All remote routers can access to DMZ as same as R1. but ping is not allowed. I think that all remote is connected to internal network router, so they can access without any permit access-list. 3. Other Ports are default allow security high => Low, But Ping is not allow, How can I open ping/icmp? (internal to DMZ) please give me a access-list command., To allow ping you need to inspect it. The syntax might vary a little depending on your ASA but it should look something like this policy-map global_policy class inspection_default inspect icmp The default behavior of ASA is to permit access from higher level interface (like 100) to lower level interface (like 50).

Sorry, all this VPN and ASA configurations arekind of new to me as I've been learning from some articles I've found in the internettrying toimplement it, probably I'm missing a deep knowledge of some important concepts. Thanks a lot, Patty Attachment: asa_startup-config_v2.txt router1841_startup-config_v2.txt, That config looks much better now. Typically, it's easier to learn first the foundation of router- and ASA-operation, which includes NAT, and then go further with things like IPSec. But here we go: On both devices you need NAT rules that tell the router/ASA not to NAT the traffic that comes from the local network and goes to the remote network. For the router it could look like the following: ip access-list extended NAT deny ip any 172.16.0.0 0.15.255.255 permit ip 172.16.0.0 0.15.255.255 any! ip nat inside source list NAT interface FastEthernet0/0 overload Whenever you communicate *to* a network 172.16.0.0/12 (which includes your remote network) the traffic is not NATed. Whenever you communicate from your local private addresses to anywhere else, the traffic is NATed. For the ASA, it's completely different: nat (inside,outside) source static internal-subnet internal-subnet destination static TERASA-subnet TERASA-subnet no-proxy-arp route-lookup Here I used the existing objects for Identity NAT, when you start to use the VPN for multiple local or remote subnets, then I would configure extra objects/object-groups for that. For testing, make sure that the triggering traffic is part of your crypto-definition. On the router you could use an extended ping: ping 172.23.101.100 source vlan 101, Thanks for your answer, the problem is the ASA is recognising the nat as an invalid input: asa#nat (inside,outside) source static internal-subnet internal-subnet destination static TERRASA-subnet TERRASA-subnet no-proxy-arp route-lookup ^ % Invalid input detected at '^' marker.

53,53,dpatten78,"[user1, asker, user2, asker, user2, user2]","[If you do a ""show interface tunnel xxx"" after a minute of running does it show a lot of traffic? And to clarify, this is an existing working configuration that has just recently developed the issue. Correct?, Its been resolved with TAC help. Enabled netflow top talkers and saw a lab host pushing a ton of traffic across this router. Blocked with an ACL and the problem went away., Thanks for the update. just curious what kind of traffic it was? probably unreachable destination causing generation of icmp unreachable packets hence causing high CPU..or some traffic which was not cef switched?, I would believe so although at the time I wasn't able to verify what it was doing. I do know theoffendinghost was generating 4000+ flows to single IPon the far side of the DMVPN tunnels. So much that it caused an issue on the DMVPN hub router as well. Once I blocked that host the flows dropped to 200 give or take.  The destination IP doesn't resolve today so I am not even sure it ever was valid, if it wasn't that would match up with your theory on ICMP unreachable packets.

We have dual hub dual cloud and if either tunnel is up the CPU spikes to 99% and the router starts dropping packets. If I shut both tunnels down everything returns to normal and I have no idea what could be causing it? Something pushing a lot of data across the DMVPN tunnels?

Am I correct in assuming that this is what I'm to use? rsakeypair ""my key pair"" 2. The following command also did not work to generate the CSR  crypto ca enroll CA1 However, I found the following command. Am I correct in assuming this is what is needed? crypto pki enroll ""my trustpoint name"" I assume both commands were correct as I was able to generate a certificate on the terminal. Thanks, Corey, Hello I assumed it was for an ASA, for the commands it looks like you made the request on a cisco router. The process is the same but like you mentioned the commands are alittle different and they are correct. The rsakeypair command s pecifies which key pair to associate with the certificcate. crypto pki enroll, generates certificate request and displays the request. Please rate! Thanks., Great.

To be able to do that the ASA's outside IP address would have to be included in the encryption domain, which it normally is not. Yes, you can use IKEv1 and IKEv2 at the same time. However if you are changing consider using SSL instead. It is better supported and less painful. If you choose to ignore this advice, then I would create a new IKEv2 VPN rather than modifying the existing one, and then migrate users across to it. Reverse route injection does exactly what you describe. They appear as static routes on the ASA, which you then have to redistribute into whatever routing protocol you like. I wouldn't normally use it for user traffic, but for site to site traffic when handling more complex failover scenarios.

58,58,steve_coady,"[user1, user2, user1, user2, user1]","[Hello, In case that they are requesting that you accept any public IP as the peer because their IP is dynamic you need to configurea dynamic to static site to site tunnel in this way you can accept their connection to your ASA. You will need to use the default tunnel group and setup the pre-share key there, it should not affect the other tunnels because if the other tunnel are static you have created a more specific tunnels for that particular peer Here is a document that will explain this dynamic to static site to site configuration using ASDM and CLI http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-nex..., Diego Thank you for the response. We currently have a Dynamic crypto map in place,crypto map VPN 65535 ipsec-isakmp dynamic DYNAMIC. In the ASDM it has a priority of 65535.10. What show commands can i run to verify this dynamic statement is not already being used for another instance? I see where any static entries I have made always are above this dynamic statement Should I create another Dynamic instance and define it as 65535.20 Does it matter where these Dynamic statements fall in the list of crypto maps?, You don't need to create a new dynamic map you can reuse that one for all the dynamic ips in case you're getting otherpeers withit. The dynamic map should be the last crypto map to avoid problems with the static ones., Diego On a scale of 1 to 10 (riskiest) how risky is this type of implementation? Based on what I am reading anyone who gets this pre-shared key could use this tunnel into my network!, Using pre-share keys as authentication method will always represent a higher risk even for the static tunnels you can reduce the risk by configuring a strong enough password with considerable amount of characters and symbols. If you don't feel comfortable using pre-share keys for this particular implementation you can use certificate authentication, this will increase the security for this tunnel. Only the peers with the certificate will be able to authenticate against your ASA to establish a secure VPN tunnel.

From you information there is really a very high chanse that this is a DNS issue. Second. Could you check by ""nslookup"" comand at the WinOS command line what DNS server it tryes to use for resolving IP address? What shows traceroute to DNS server (that shows by ""nslookup"")? Third. Do you have a rule at your VPN connection to use your office DNS server? Best Regards., Thanks for the response AllertGen. Yes this seems to be DNS issue but what causing this? And why only some users are affected and others are not...Any idea? nslookup shows internal DNS server for resolving both intranet & internet sites which looks strange. For traceroute, will check once i got a access to affected user's machine. Yes we have rule defined under VPN profile to use office DNS & WINS for intranet queries., to clarify the users that have problems can get to the Internet ok when NOT using the VPN, Are the users having problems have the same type of device/OS? if windows clients can you do a ""ipconfig /all"" before vpn is activated and after vpn activated. thanks, It would be good to use ""route print"" comand too before and after VPN connection. Best Regards., I have attached the required output to this thread. Let me know what is your observation on this. Thank You.. Attachment: vpn_test-1.txt, Hi. Sorry for a long response. I see a strange case at your configuration: DNS Servers...........: 10.55.52.20 172.16.1.20 and there is no route to this network: 10.55.48.0 255.255.248.0 10.55.51.1 10.55.51.116 2 10.55.51.0 255.255.255.128 On-link 10.55.51.116 257 10.55.51.116 255.255.255.255 On-link 10.55.51.116 257 10.55.51.127 255.255.255.255 On-link 10.55.51.116 257......................... 172.16.0.0 255.240.0.0 10.55.51.1 10.55.51.116 2 And in the same time you can get access to DNS by ICMP requests: >ping 10.55.52.20 Pinging 10.55.52.20 with 32 bytes of data: Reply from 10.55.52.20: bytes=32 time=34ms TTL=127 There is 3 DNS servers that your OS can try for resolving a DNS name: 10.55.52.20 172.16.1.86 192.168.1.1 It is also possible to have a problem with access to 2 first DNS servers. Better to check VPN Firewall for it. Also can you provide an output of command ""nslookup [FQDN]"" at the time of the problem? Best Regards., @AllertGen  Correct me if I'm wrong but 10.55.52.20 (DNS Server) comes under subnet 10.55.48.0/21 i.e 255.255.248.0. The last host in this subnet is 10.55.55.254. For IP 172.16.1.86, this is a internal web host & not a DNS server. 192.168.1.1 is a default gateway & could be used as a NBNS for wireless users at home., Hi. Yes, you're right. My bad. I didn't looked at the netmask. So need to check output of nslookup [fqdn] (for example fqdn can be www.google.com) command at the time of the problem. About the 172.16.1.20. This server inside of DNS servers in the AnyConnect interface: DNS Servers...........: 10.55.52.20 172.16.1.20 So your client could use this IP for resolving DNS names. If it's not a DNS server at you internal network you need to change settings of the VPN connection at your network device. And about 192.168.1.1. VPN adapter DNS settingses usually prefered at the Windows. But if DNS servers of VPN failed Windows should try to use DNS of the Wi-Fi adapter. And as I think it doesn't happens. Best Regards., You are describing the exact same problem I have! Did you make any progress on the troubleshooting you may want to share? I'm pretty sure that this is a OS problem (Win7) because all users use the same config but only a few have the problems described. In our case it even happens that the problem does not occur on cable nic but on the WLAN interface., Thanks Walter for your attention. Yes, it could be OS problem but couldn't understand why it causing to only few users. We haven't observed same issue on cable nic yet. The problem is we could not reproduce this issue in lab environment where we can conclude what could be the problem. What are the troubleshooting steps done by you on this issue?, as you already wrote in your intro, we also found that the resolver is not working properly: ping google.de NOT OK, but ping 8.8.8.8 is ok changing the DNS server for the WLAN NIC to 8.8.8.8 could 'solve' the problem. No other troubleshooting steps were done- currently we work with Cisco to solve the problem., Thanks Sebastian, fanatic1217 & Walter for your responses. @Walter Obergehrer  Yes, it works when we put manual DNS entry as public DNS. When i ran packet capture i see all name queries to be resolved using NBNS (NetBIOS Name Service) towards access point's IP and there is no DNS packets seen in that capture. Appreciate if you us know if you get any solution from TAC. I think this issue is faced by so many users & probably issue seems to be because of NBNS queries. You can google it. @Sebastian Velez  Yes will check by disabling IPv6 under wireless adapter. This below issue seems to be similar http://superuser.com/questions/629559/why-is-my-computer-suddenly-using-.... Thanks Again..!!, @Sebastian Velez  I've tried disabling the IPv6 and this seems to be working. What could be problem & why it is working after disabling the IPv6?

We had been using split tunneling for a long time and after our IOS Upgrade, the internet would work for some users and not others. I tried troubleshooting for about 2-3 weeks on/off but was unable to determine the solution even with the help of CISCO TAC. I decided that we shouldn't be using split-tunnel anyway and disabled the feature. We are better off security-wise without it, but I definitely believe that it was IOS related bug., Gaurav, Have you tried disabling the IPv6 option under the physical adapter?, Hi Gaurav, Have you tried the following command under the group-pollicy: client-bypass-protocol enable This should fix the problem without disabling the IPv6 feature on the adapter., Thanks Sebastian.

62,62,NPT_2,"[user1, user2, asker, user2, asker, user2]","[Have you got your ASA SmartNet contract loaded against your CCO username?, AnyConnect 4.x changed the licensing model. AnyConnect 4.x licenses are term based vs the perpetual 3.x licenses. There are a number of other differences mainly due to there being only two license types- Plus and Apex- no more Mobile, Advanced Endpoint Assessment, shared VPN etc. Cisco has been offering a nominal or no cost migration license through the end of 2015. (depending on what you have: Essentials to Plus or Apex to Premium) AnyConnect 3.1 will work with Windows 10 and the latest ASA software (since Version 3.1.10010). Reference: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyc... There are two ways it is distributed- as a standalone installation package or for distribution from the ASA headend. Both come in Windows, Mac OS X and Linux distributions. For a Windows client you would use either: anyconnect-win-3.1.12020-pre-deploy-k9.iso anyconnect-win-3.1.12020-k9.pkg...for the current version in those respective form factors., Thanks, that sounds like Cisco changing up their licensing model, and not necessarily for the better. Since we only have the included bundled AnyConnect licenses (either 2 or 4, not sure if the failover unit adds to my simultaneous connectionlicense count) and 3.1 works with Windows 10 I will likely just use that for now. I noticed that the ASA License shows an unlimited IPsec VPN license included. Is there a free IP Sec VPN client available that anyone has successfully used with the ASA's and Windows 10 64Bit? I know the latest Cisco one doesn't work (at least without a bunch of unsupported tweaks) and it has been a while since Cisco released the last IPsec VPN Client., Yes they have definitely changed the licensing model. Each customer's environment varies but Cisco does have a licensing ""story"" that actually does show the new model is better for the majority of customers. (Of course it just coincidentally is much better for Cisco too:).). If you have an HA pair and no additional licenses activated you do get 2 + 2 = 4 ""Premium"" (old style of Premium and not the new Apex which also includes the Mobile and Advanced Endpoint Assessment bits that used to be separate) licenses for free. The unlimited IPsec VPN license is really intended more for site-site VPN as theold Cisco IPsec VPN client is indeed end of sales and no longer developed for some time. Reference: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/vpn-client/end... You're right one can tweak/hack a system to make it work on Windows 10 but that's not very sustainable. SSL VPN with either clientless (AnyConnect Apex license required) or using the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client (VPN module) is the strategic solution forward. (You can setup IPsec IKEv2 as an alternative to that but it still requires the AnyConnect license on the ASA.), I haven't tried the SSL VPNroute yet, but have thought about it. Since we don't have Apex licenses can I just configure the SSL VPN on the ASA's and connect to the ASA's and let it load the appropriate VPN client software, or do I still need to load the Anyconnect 3.1 client manually on a laptop?, If you want to download software from the ASA you need to put the image file (*.pkg) on the ASA. The one they ship with my default is typically pretty old (AnyConnect 2.5 last I checked). If you have that version or later already manually installed, that's fine.

I am also looking at the logs from the ASA and I do not see my connection attempt. Attachment: dartbundle_1228_1012.zip, Diego, According the the logs from the ASA once I get the connection I receive no IP address. Checking the ASDM log buffer I do not see the Client getting pass the NAT statement. Nor the DHCP server on inside. object-group network VPN-DHCP network-object host 10.10.10.129 nat (outside,outside) source dynamic any interface destination static VPN-DHCP VPN-DHCP description SRHVPN connection, You have a dhcp server configured on the tunnel-group. That would take preference for address assignment. Order of address assignment is AAA,DHCP and then local. tunnel-group SRHVPN general-attributes address-pool (outside) SRHVPN address-pool SRHVPN default-group-policy GroupPolicy_SRHVPN dhcp-server 10.10.10.253 I would recommend removing that configuration if you are not using a dhcp server. Also, sometimes when DHCP is assigned, the ASA might disable the local vpn address assignment. The default is a hidden command so you have to see ""show run all"" to see it. Like this: ASA# sh run all | in vpn-addr no vpn-addr-assign aaa no vpn-addr-assign dhcp vpn-addr-assign local reuse-delay 0 If you are only using the local pool to assign ip addresses, the above would be the config you need. If you need DHCP or AAA ip address assignment enabled the setting by adding the command., Rahul, Yes I am using a DHCP server, when the client get through the FW. So I need to get rid of one of these. When I look at my configuration the dhcp server is doing the assigning and not the local. vpn-addr-assign aaa vpn-addr-assign dhcp no vpn-addr-assign local no ipv6-vpn-addr-assign aaa no ipv6-vpn-addr-assign local. Yet I am not getting a IP address. On the dhcp server I have a IP network ready for connectivity., Makes more sense now. If you want the DHCP server to assign an ip address, leave the ""dhcp-server"" sub-command as it is in the tunnel-group config. If you have a DHCP scope defined in the DHCP server, configure that scope subnet under the group-policy. Like this: group-policy GroupPolicy_SRHVPN internal group-policy GroupPolicy_SRHVPN attributes!--- define the DHCP network scope in the group policy.This configuration is Optional dhcp-network-scope 192.168.5.0 This will get you an ip address in the scope you have specified. Reference this document to verify your configurations again: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/anyconnect-secure-mob... If DHCP is still failing, run the ""debug dhcpc detail 255"" to see what happens during DHCP transaction., I removed all references to the local pool within the ASA.

65,65,h.prochazka,[user1],"[Hi Hessel This behavior is completely normal, The lifetime is the maximum time the SA can be used for rekeying. The value you enter in the configuration as the lifetime is different from the rekey time of the SA. The rekey time must always be smaller than the lifetime in order to allow for multiple attempts in case the first rekey attempt fails.The time will vary depending on the platform used, which software version, etc. If the ASA is the initiatorit is normal that it will rekey at 75% of the lifetime set, this matches with the time that you are seeing for the rekey if your timer is 28800 then you should see the rekey at 21600 aprox You can check this documentation for more information: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-nex...]",[0],1,2015-12-22,12734506,1,1,"Dear all, I've been struggling to understand some debug output from my ASA which has a VPN configured with a remote checkpoint.

It seems Android is actually trying several TSs, no? esp-aes 256 esp-sha-hmac seems to be only the first one. and then the others are tried as well., Hey, I think you might be matching the defect. https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCth50464/?reffering_site=dumpcr It says it apply for Windows connections, but checking some internal notes, this behavior is also reproducible with Android devices. The Android devices does'not support NAT-OA, so It's unable to build a tunnel which traverse NAT, especially if the headend is behind NAT. If your router is behind NAT, you should be matching this behavior, looks like moving to IPSEC or Anyconnect will be desirable on this situation. Hope it helps-Randy-, The page you sent is not available. It says: Insufficient Permissions to View Bug This bug contains proprietary information and is not yet publicly available. You may find useful information within the Cisco Support Community But in fact my router is behind NAT. Do you think, if I create a loopback interface with a public IP address and instead of NATing the packets I route them towards the router, it will work?, In fact the main problem is NAT-T, if avoid the connection to pass through a NAT-T should work.  The loopback solution seems to be a possible workaround. Enjoy the holidays!-Randy-]",[4],1,2015-12-18,12732216,1,5,"Hello, I have set up an L2PT/IPSEC tunnel using a router Cisco 1905, which is behind a FW Cisco ASA. This tunnel is to be established between the router and mobile devices, mainly iPhones and Androids. For the sake of troubleshooting, I made sure the FW would not be in the way (opened all necessary ports, configured NAT and routes, etc). It turns out the iPhones establish the tunnel correctly but Androids fail. Apparently the problem is phase 2 of IPSec, especifically where it says in the debug Dec 18 12:42:34.226: IPSEC(ipsec_process_proposal): invalid transform proposal flags-- 0x800 Dec 18 12:42:34.226: ISAKMP:(1028): IPSec policy invalidated proposal with error 1024 I tried AES and 3DES in the transform-sets but it seems it just doesnÂ´t work.

This tunnel is to be established between the router and mobile devices, mainly iPhones and Androids. For the sake of troubleshooting, I made sure the FW would not be in the way (opened all necessary ports, configured NAT and routes, etc). It turns out the iPhones establish the tunnel correctly but Androids fail. Apparently the problem is phase 2 of IPSec, especifically where it says in the debug Dec 18 12:42:34.226: IPSEC(ipsec_process_proposal): invalid transform proposal flags-- 0x800 Dec 18 12:42:34.226: ISAKMP:(1028): IPSec policy invalidated proposal with error 1024 I tried AES and 3DES in the transform-sets but it seems it just doesnÂ´t work.

81,81,ramesh.8901,"[user1, user2, user1, user3]","[Hi Ramesh, Which device are you using to load-balance the traffic? It seems the problem might be there, as per when you connect using the ASA IP the disconnections stop. Hope it helps,-Randy-, Hi rvarelac, I thought as much as well; I am currently using an F5 GTM to load balance; however the only thing that the F5 device ever does is return an IP address. It acts as a DNS response device. So once a user connects to the portal, the DNS server would never come into the picture after that. So was wondering what is actually causing the issue., Hi Ramesh, You can double check the ASA enabling logs and debugs, a ""show logging"" and ""debug webvpn 255"" will be useful to check if the ASA is disconnecting the session. Alternative you can run wireshark on a computer and check the IP the reset is comming, Cheers,-Randy-, What is the load balancing mechanism being used? I'm not too familiar with F5 operation, but we had a similar load balancing issue. If it is a ""round robin"" style load balancing, then secondary requests from the client could be going to different ASAs. Therfore the client disconnects.Remember that the clent connection to the portal is still an SA, and if a secondary connection is sent to adifferent firewall, you'll experience issues. If you use ""client affinity"" style load balancing the load balancer then the load balancer will know that the client with source ip ""X"" was connected to firewall ""A"", and it will continue sending the traffic to firewall ""A"". This is not always ideal because if clients come from behind a proxy server, then all clients from the same proxy server will be directed to the same firewall.]",[2],1,2015-12-05,12721606,0,4,"Hi All, I've set up two Firewalls in two DCs- London and Swindon.

89,89,andyblaylock,"[user1, user1, user2, user1, user2, user1, user2, user2]","[there will be no problem, just need another crypto isakmp key with the new Site public Ip address I assume you have static public IP addresses for your sites. and configure a new tunnel interface., Since this config is configuring ISAKMP keys using address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 there is no requirement for a new crypto isakmp key with the new site address. Just configure the VTI on the new router and on one or both of the existing routers. One aspect of this implementation which the original poster should consider is how they want data to flow when the third router is implemented. With two routers you just have a simple point to point connection. When you introduce the third router do you want one of the routers to act as hub? In this situation the hub router has tunnels to each of the remote spokes. Each remote spoke has a tunnel to the hub. Spoke to spoke communication is possible but will have to go to the hub and then out to the other remote. The other option is a mesh configuration where each router has VTI tunnel to each other router. HTH Rick, Hello Richard, Thanks for the guidance. I think I'll be configuring a full mesh, no hub. So on each router Id create two tunnels, Tunnel0 and Tunnel1. Router 1 would have Tunnel0 going to Router2 and Tunnel1 going to Router 3, is that correct? Thanks Richard, Andy, Andy Yes when you have 3 routers each router will have 2 tunnels, one tunnel to each of the peer routers. You would set up routing logic so that router 1 knows to get to addresses on router 2 via tunnel 0 and get to addresses on router 3 via tunnel 1. The each way to accomplish that is to run a dynamic routing protocol and have the routing protocol run over the tunnels. The main thing to watch out for in that environment is that you do not want the dynamic routing protocol to advertise the tunnel destination address as reachable through the tunnel. I am glad that my suggestion was helpful. Thank you for using the rating system to mark this question as answered. This will help other readers in the forum to identify discussions that have helpful information. HTH Rick, Hi Rick, I do have OSPF configured as the routing protocol between the sites. Your comment "" The main thing to watch out for in that environment is that you do not want the dynamic routing protocol to advertise the tunnel destination address as reachable through the tunnel"" Im using /30's for the tunnel network between the sites. Under the OSPF statements I do have a network statement for the tunnel network, I was thinking I'd need this so the routers would form an OSPF adjacency. Are you saying that I should not have this network advertised in OSPF? As it can cause a problem. Thanks for the guidance Rick. Andy, Andy If you have already configured OSPF as the routing protocol for the sites then that is good and should work for the VTI tunnels. If you have /30 IP addresses assigned as the tunnel IP addresses and have OSPF network statements that match these addresses it is good. What is not good is to have OSPF advertise the tunnel destination address. To help make it clear let us clarify a little terminology. A tunnel has a tunnel IP address. For R1 the tunnel IP address is 10.0.1.1 and there should be an OSPF network statement that includes this address. A tunnel also has a tunnel destination address (similar name but quite different function) and for R1 the tunnel destination address is 2.2.2.1. This is the address that should not be advertised in OSPF. HTH Rick, Got it makes sense. Thanks for the explanation. Andy, Hello Richard, Thanks for your input..

I used the topology below, but wont be much of a difference if you use the VPN over the internet. I just had my lab set up this way at the moment. So basically I have a IKEv2 VPN set up between two ASAs and ASA2 is forwarding all its traffic to ASA1 and out to the internet, except for telnet traffic to 155.0.35.3. To achive this I had to first have a deny statement in the crypto ACL on the ASA2 for traffic to R3 and then also do dynamic NAT for telnet traffic towards R3. It's a bit of reverse logic from normal NAT statements when dealing with IPsec. In section 1 of NAT I do dynamic NAT, and then in section 3 I do dynamic NAT.

For that i need to create acl to allow internet traffic right? What NAT config should i do on our ASA1? It needs PAT rule. Regards Mahesh Attachment: drawing1.jpg, Hi Actually i realised you don't need to edit the crypto ACL. This is because the NAT process is done before you classify if traffic should traverse the VPN.

And on the branches only ISR2 something like Cisco 1900 or Cisco 2900 with SEC license. If you identify what traffic you have and the BW usage needed, I can me more precise., Thanks omar for your reply we will use ethernet connection with bandwidth no mor than 8 mbps thanks, For scenarios like these I would typicallygo for IOS routers on both the HQ and the branches. There you can tunnel-interfaces which make implementing VPNs really easy and gives you the flexibility to extend your VPN in the future. The decision which devices to take depend purely on the needed throughput and the type of WAN-interface for the branches (like Ethernet or DSL). Another possibility which make the VPN-implementation even easier would be the Cisco Meraki MX appliances on both the branches and the HQ., Thank you karsten for your reply we will use ethernet connection with bandwidth no more than 8 mbps thanks, For the branches you could use the c881. For the HQ I would look at one or two of the new 4331. The c800 is much faster than 8 mps, the 4331 is capable of 100 Mbps and can be upgraded to 300 mbps with a license. For the alternatesolution, you could use Meraki MX64 at the branches and MX 84 at the HQ. With that you also havea really goodfirewall andthe possibility to add content inspection., Iam very glad that you helped me but there is one more thing to ask about which licensing do i need for c881 and 4331 and which software images, is the default license and image for c881 is good for my work and it says its default so is that mean its free? and what about the 4331 router images and license? thank you alot for your help, The C881-K9 comesby default with an Advanced Security license. There is an optional Advanced IP license for more routing options. For the 4331, the SEC-Bundle is needed.

103,103,Charger1129,"[user1, user2, asker, user2, asker, user2]","[Hi,  When you say you can access internet but not internal LAN resources, I belive you've configured Split-tunnel. The most common issue could be because of NAT-Exemption statement being missed. Ensure that you've configured NAT-Exemption with source as inside LAN subnets and destination as Anyconnect VPN Pool. You can confirm the same by running packet-tracer command. Please get the following output, split-acl configuration, Anyconnect VPN pool and the subnet you're trying to access so that I can have a look into it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Packet-tracer input inside icmp &lt;Internal_host_ip_address> 8 0 &lt;Anyconnect_assigned_ip_address> detail   Internal_host_ip_address Ã  The internal host (desktop) which you are trying to access  Anyconnect_assigned_ip_address Ã  IP address assigned to the client machine once connected to vpn. This must be from VPN pool configured --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HTH, Kannan, I believe that the suggestion about NAT exemption is very good. If that does not turn out to be the issue then I have a couple of other suggestions.- with the VPN session established look into the information from the AnyConnect and look into the route detailstaband be sure that these LAN addresses show up as secured routes.- verify that the devices in the LAN that you can not reach have a route to the addresses in the VPN pool. HTH Rick, Hi Rich, Looks like I only have the following for the routes which could be my issue: Non-Secured Routes (0.0.0.0/0) Secured Routes (10.31.90.0/24) The 10.31.90.0 is my VPN network. The Network I am trying to reach is the 10.31.20.0, Yes that would be an issue and would explain the symptom that you are having. You need to make sure that your configuration for split tunnel also includes your inside addresses. HTH Rick, Figured it out now, had my ACL statements and NAT backwards by listing the VPN subnetas the source when really it should have been the destination. Incorrect: access-list SPLIT_TUNNELextended permit ip object NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.90.0_24 object NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.20.0_24  nat (inside,outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.90.0_24NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.90.0_24 destination static NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.20.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.20.0_24 no-proxy-arp route-lookup Correct: access-list SPLIT_TUNNELextended permit ip object NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.20.0_24 object NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.90.0_24  nat (inside,outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.20.0_24NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.20.0_24 destination static NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.90.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_10.31.90.0_24 no-proxy-arp route-lookup, I am glad that my suggestion was helpful and did lead you to a solution.

You need to create 2 connection profiles here and map them with 2 group-policy allowing access to 2 differernt resources (they can be multiple as well) Here is a reference document:- http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/100936-asa8x-split-tunnel-anyconnect-config.html Regards, Dinesh Moudgil P.S.

I know is obsolete, I needed to know the name of its replacement (HostScan I beleive):D I want to make sure that the PC is part of the domain ABC, has software XYZ and software QWE. Thanks for the tip Dinesh. Rolando Valenzuela., Rolando, In such a case, you can use HostScan (Endpoint Assessment) along with DAP policies to confirm the OS version, AV version, registry keys and certain applications on the workstation with VPNclient. Using Advanced Endpoint Assessment, you can have the user upgrade its AV version so that it in compliance with the policy that is created on the headend. You might want to check this document  for your reference. Regards, Dinesh Moudgil P.S. Please rate helpful posts., Awesome! Thanks again. Rolando Valenzuela., Dinesh Moudgil, just one last question, where can I download it?? all the documentation sends me to this site, but there is nothing there. A few places says that I can uses a version of AnyConnect-win-version-k9.pkg, but the one I have installed doesn't include that module. Any suggestion?, Hi Rolando, If you browse to Anyconnect download page at https://goo.gl/CfVjs4 . you can download "" Full installation package- Windows / Head-end deployment (PKG)  anyconnect-win-3.1.11004-k9.pkg "" t2.png This package includes the hostscan image as well. You can download it seperately as well or just download the above said package and it will include all the other modules as well. For checking the contents of the package, once downloaded, you can extract the files from the above package (with the help of WinRar or any other utility software). Regards, Dinesh Moudgil P.S. Please rate helpful posts., Dinesh,  How do we define the registry entry if we can not define the location of the registry entry on hostscan (see Attached)? The option is located under the Secure Desktop Manager Tree. I'm about to un-install the pre-login config as a part of removing CSD. My concern is DAP will not be able to accomplish the same registry lookups if hostscan no longer knows where to look for them? Please advise. Attachment: 4116612c468c2635.jpg, Check the attached file, maybe it can help you, you need to do this configuration AFTER installing HostScan (in my case is hostscan_3.1.10010-k9.pkg) The path is under Configuration > Remote Access VPN > Secure Desktop Mangager > Host Scan Hope this helps Rolando Valenzuela. Attachment: 1.png 2.png 3.png, Rolando,  Thanks for the info, however I might have mis-understood what will actually occur when CSD is not used. From what I have found out is even though CSD is disabled the host scan option that falls under CSD will still be a configurable option. Which is actually what you were posting about. I have several entries already in the host scan endpoint options. I was nervous we would lose that feature. Again Sorry for the confusion and thanks for the quick response.

As expected I wasnt even looking at this, too focused on the IPSEC config. Still wont work though but I wonder if its an issue with my ISP. Ping from router 2 to 1 and p1&2 both come up encap packets on both routers but only decap on router 1. Both of my routers terminal to external connections without ASA's so I'm not sure what would cause this. Pings between external addresses work fine. Any ideas or likely to be ISP firewall?, With an IPSEC tunnel it should not be anything in between then two routersif the tunnel has fully established. So it sounds like some packets are not being sent into the tunnel from one end. Perhaps if you post the configurations it might help. Jon, Hmmm ok, thanks Jon. Sorry as you can tell I've got a lot to learn! How can the encap counter go up if the packet hasnt gone in to the tunnel? Configs are exactly as before but with the access-list 100 changed as per your post., Sorry, I misread your post. If both are showing encaps then yes that should mean you should see decaps for both. I misread it to mean you were seeing decaps only at one end. Like I say though if the tunnel has come up then the packets are encapsulated within that tunnel so any firewall in between doesn't see those, it only sees the outer headers which we know areallowed through or your tunnel wouldn't have come up. If you see what I mean. Whatare the src and dst IPs you are testing with? When you do test VPNs it is better to test from end clients and not the actual routers themselves. Jon, Thanks again for your relply. Tried ping between hosts 192.168.20.119- 192.168.30.101 as well as the routers with the same outcome.

Both routers can ping each other so connectivity is there. Both routers have static routes to the opposites router local ip range pointing out the wan interface. Both routers have ACLs (155) to catch traffic heading to the other router and thats associcated to the cryptomap. Both routers have the map on the external interface. Yet no attempt to set up a SA. Debug on both shows nothing, show crypto isakmp sa shows nothing. Please help save my sanity!

Attachment: vpn.png, 1.now i want to know is to whom should i ask for an access list IP? should i create it or do i need to ask for my Partner to set it for me so that i can put it in. The access list consists of the IP's / subnets of your local LAN and the remote LAN. So the source in the ACL will be your local LAN and destination will be the remote LAN. access-list 101 extended permit ip &lt;Local IP> &lt;subnet> &lt;Remote IP> &lt;subnet> 2.is the transfer set name given by my partner or i will have to create it on my own. The transform set name is only locally significant. However it does specify the phase 2 encryption standards so this part will need to be coordinated with the peer. crypto ipsec transform-set MYSET esp-aes esp-sha-hmac in the above transform set, MYSET is just a local significant name so you can reference it in a crypto map. the esp-ae esp-sha-hmac is the encryption part which needs to be agreed upon by you and your peer. As per the image you posted you would be using esp-3des esp-sha-hmac. 3. since i see the policy of the first VPN client (partner) is set to Policy 10 should i make also each VPN on Policy 10 or Policy number doesn't matter. Policy number is a sequence number and is matched in a top to bottom fashion until a match is found. If no match is found then Phase 1 will not complete and the tunnel be established. It matters if you have several peers and some of they use different phase 1 settings. If this is the case you will need to use different sequence numbers for each policy. 4. i have also seen that we have the 2 phase security association lifetime which one to use? Both are used, and they are both at their defaults so you do not need to do any configuration for those.-- Please remember to select a correct answer and rate helpfull posts]",[2],1,2015-10-26,12689281,0,3,"Dear Team I would like to seek your quick assistance... am not a Cisco Guru but i would like to know if i can get an assistance on how to add a VPN to an existing one.

You say you want to NAT the source IP and then at the same time doa NAT exempt. It's one or the other. Also can the connection be initiated from both sides or just your side? Jon, Hi Shina,  You can refer following link for detailed explanation and configuration of S2S VPN with overlapping subnets.  http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-nex...  Let us know if you have any issues.  Hope it helps!!! Thanks, R.Seth Mark the answer as correct if it helps in resolving your query!!!, Hi Jon Well I need to NAT first because of the overlap on the remote end, then because its going over the VPN a NAT exempt also has to exsist right? The only other NAT currently is to translate inside interface to a public IP on the outside interface.. do you mean i wouldn't need a NAT exempt and to just do the NAT and apply it prior to the other NAT rules? The connection will be initiated from both sides, but the remote side will be using the address i NAT to (since they are aware of the overlap) if so can you please post the config of the NATs, this version is really confusing., If you need to NAT over the VPN tunnel you don't then need a NAT exemption. It is one or the other and usually it is a NAT exemption which is probably why you think you need it. So at the moment you existing NAT rule would NAT 10.1.1.1 to the outside interface, is that what you are saying? And you want that to remain for general internet access but for this specific VPN tunnel you want 10.1.1.1 to be translated to 20.2.2.2. Is that correct? Jon, Hi Jon Thanks again, I think your right, usually I do NAT exempt but thats with VPN's that are not being twice natt'd. Ok so its clear only the NAT is needed. Yes the current NAT is a PAT for all inside interface addresses to the public IP of the outside interface and this is for internet access. However 10.1.1.1 also accesses the net apart from this VPN, and still needs to. I need the NAT for the VPN only to take affect if 10.1.1.1 is going to 30.1.1.1 (remote end vpn), if the source / destination differs then the PAT will take affect. This should work if I placethe VPN NAT above the PAT statement (by sequence number) correct?, You don't need to worry about sequence numbers with pre 8.3 because the NAT is different. The static policy NAT should take precedence over your PAT rule anyway. See the above posts for an example of how to do it and what to reference in your crypto map acls. Jon, Jon, I dont think the policy NAT mentioned below is correct:  ""access-list policy-nat extended permit ip &lt;realip/mask of siteA> &lt;Mapped IP of remote end(siteB)> 255.255.255.0 static (inside,outside) &lt;Mapped IP of site A> access-list policy-nat""  Am not trying to NAT the remote end (site b), site B has IP of 30.3.3.3. My local IP is 10.1.1.1, this IP / subnet already exists on site b network, thus I have to NAT my local IP to another IP (20.2.2.2) which is not used on site B network, before its sent out over the VPN tunnel. So essentially, site B will always see / talk to the NAT address of (20.2.2.2) and this is the IP that has to be referenced in their crypto acl as the ""interesting traffic"" My problem is how to do this NAT, its essentially a twice NAT on my side., It is not a twice NAT. So 10.1.1.1 issimply translated to20.2.2.2 when the destination IP is 30.3.3.3. So that example is correct ie. your acl references the real IP of 10.1.1.1 and a destination IP of 3.3.3.3. Then the static policy NAT statement uses 20.2.2.2 and references the acl. That is policy NAT. Jon, Can you mark Risabeth's answer as correct as well as he supplied the configuration, I just explained it:-) Is everything clear now? Jon, Hi,  Consider siteA and siteB with overlapping IP subnets then your NAT would looks like:  access-list policy-nat extended permit ip &lt;realip/mask of siteA> &lt;Mapped IP of remote end(siteB)> 255.255.255.0 static (inside,outside) &lt;Mapped IP of site A> access-list policy-nat  Thanks, R.Seth, edited- just ignore. Jon, I dont think this NAT is right, you mention:  ""access-list policy-nat extended permit ip &lt;realip/mask of siteA> &lt;Mapped IP of remote end(siteB)> 255.255.255.0 static (inside,outside) &lt;Mapped IP of site A> access-list policy-nat""  Am not trying to NAT the remote end (site b), site B has IP of 30.3.3.3.

122,122,rakesh24csco,[user1],"[a). Theoretically, skipping Phase 1 and doing everything in Phase 2 (for aggressive mode only) would probably be a good idea to make it more secure. However, this would require a complete redesign of the IKE protocol. As you probably already know, aggressive mode is by default only used for remote access VPN, and I have never seen it used for site to site at any of the clients I have come into contact with. Aggressive mode, in my opinion, would only be used in situations where a lot of VPN tunnels are built and torn down constantly (as with RA VPNs) to save on hardware resources. But...It is what it is, not a very secure method to use. b). The pre-shared key is used to create a hash and that hash is sent to the remote peer. If that remote peer can create the same hash using its own pre-shared key then the peers know that they share the same secrets. The issue with aggressive mode is that the hash is sent in plain text so if an attacker is able to capture that data they could preform an off-line brute force attack. c). I believe this has to do with the fact that aggressive mode sends its identity in clear text and therefore does not need to be pre-configured as a peer address as it does with tunnels with static addresses at both ends.-- Please remember to select a correct answer and rate helpful posts]",[0],1,2015-10-24,12680161,0,1,"Hello, I have some doubts about VPN.

I wasn't able to find any documentation that specifically stated that it came as a PAK. In this case, this person already has the license, but it was never installed. We may need to get the PAK re-issued., Hi Clayton,  Are you able to resolve this because I am also facing the same issue and I am not aware how to generate the PAK for plus and apex license from premium license.  Thanks in advance Regards, Hi Pranav, I was able to get the AnyConnect Mobile PAK's reissued by contacting licensing@cisco.com. Provide them your sales order # and any other pertinent information you have. I'm not clear on your issue though. You don't generate a PAK for Plus/Apex FROM a premium license. Plus & Apex are the new licensing options for AnyConnect. Premium & Essentials are the old licenses that are End of Sale. If you are purchasing a new set of licenses, you can only purchase Plus or Apex which includes mobile. There is no longer a separate license for AnyConnect mobile. Once you have the PAK, you can generate the license file on www.cisco.com/go/license. Upload that license file to your firewall.Does that answer your question?  The confusion that I was having was that the old AnyConnect Mobile license is not a per-user license, but rather an ""On/Off"" license.

XXX is the amount of users that are using the AnyConnect Client or the VPN at all. It's not the concurrent users but the ""living hearts"" of your userbase.

138,138,cisco8887,"[user1, asker, user1, asker, user1, asker, user1]","[If the connection is allowed through the firewall then the return traffic is automatically allowed because of the entry made in the state table. The key work in the above is ""through"". So if your inside acl had been applied inbound then the initial connection from outside would be checked against the outside acl and then allowed through because the inside acl is applied inbound so it doesn't apply. The return traffic would automatically be allowed back ie. it would bypass the inside acl applied inboundbecause the ASA has an entry in the state table. But in your case because the inside acl is applied outbound it is checked and because you hadn't allowed the traffic the connection did not go through the ASA. The direction has nothing to do with whether the source or destination IPs are directly connected to the ASA. Jon, Thanks for coming back to me  i allowed the connection on inbound on outside interface but this did not work  I allowed any any on inbound inside and still did not work  i had to allow any to host inside on outbound acl for it to work  so i think above is not a correct statement   i am also further confused how inside traffic continued to go through asa as there is an implicit deny at the end of every acl and the outbound acl had no permit any any or permit inside subnet any  also no inspection was applied to inside interface so totally confused, I think you perhaps didn't follow what I explained or just as likely I didn't explain it very well:-) So you allowed the connection inbound from the outside so it enters the ASA. Nothing you do with the acl applied inbound to the inside interface affects that connection because the direction of the connection is outbound on the inside interface. But an acl applied outbound to the inside interface will affect that connection because the traffic has not yet get gone through the ASA. So until you allowed that traffic the connection was not allowed. The return traffic for that connection however bypasses all acls because the ASA now has astate table entry so even if you had a line in your inside acl applied inbound denying the return traffic it wouldn't stop it. In terms of why traffic continued through the ASA it is what I was saying before ie. once traffic is allowed through the return traffic is automatically allowed ie. all acls are bypassed. So if the connection is made from the inside to the outside and is allowed then an acl applied outbound on the inside interface is not checked against the return traffic. It is all to do with where the connection is originated from in relation to the ASAs interfaces and if the connection is allowed through the firewall then any return traffic is automatically allowed regardless of any acls. Does this make more sense? Jon, I think what i fully don't understand is how traffic flows through the asa  my understanding is this when a packet from outside wants to go to inside as fresh traffic it is checked against outside inboud and then pass to inside inboud where as you are saying it is inside outboubd  could you help me understand this please  also when the same traffic comes in on inbound outside, does it also pass through outside outbound before going to inside inbound for it to go to inside outbound again,?  Would the flow be inside outside and the outside in without passing through outside outside and inside inside,?, Okay, I think I see where the confusion is coming from. An acl applied inbound affects traffic entering the ASA. An acl applied outbound affects traffic leaving the ASA. So a connection initiated from the outside to an inside host will arrive at the ASA on the outside interface and is entering the ASA so the inbound acl on the outside interface is checked. If you had an acl applied outbound on the outside interface it would not be checked because the traffic is going in the other direction. So continuing with the above if the traffic is allowed it then needs to be sent out of the inside interface to the destination. And because the traffic is now leaving the ASA any outbound acl applied to the interface used to exit the ASA is also checked and for arguments sake lets say it is allowed. Because the packet is allowed the ASA now makes an entry in it's state table. Once the initial packet has gone through the ASA any return traffic is not checked against any acls applied to any interfaces because the ASA is a stateful firewall and it simply checks it's state table, sees there is an entry and so allows it. For a packet going from inside to outside the same logic applies although traffic is allowed by default inside to outside without an acl. Again for the sake of argument lets say you do apply an acl inbound and outbound to the inside interface and inbound and outbound to the outside interface. The initial packet from the inside device is checked against the inside acl applied inbound (the outbound acl is not checked because it is the wrong direction).Assuming it is allowed the ASA then checksthe outbound acl on the outside interface (again not the acl applied inbound on the outside interface because it is the wrong direction). Again assuming it is allowed the packet is sent on to the destination IP. The ASA now makes a state table entry for this connection because it has been allowed through. The return traffic will now be allowed without checking anyacls. It doesn't matter that you have an aclapplied inbound on the outside interface and an aclapplied outbound on the inside interface because the ASA has a state table entry so it doesn't needto check these acls. The key point is the direction of the initial packet in relation to the ASAs interfaces and the correspondingstate table entry if the packet is allowed. Just as a side note, usually with ASAs you have an acl applied inbound on the outsideinterface and that is the most common. Optionally you may want to restrict what inside users can accesson the outside so youcan have an acl applied inboundon the inside interface. Using outbound acls is not as common as inbound ones although there are certain cases where they can be useful. So has the above helped clarify it? If not or you still have more queriesplease feel free to ask. Jon, You are a legend many thanks  is there a command to see the state entried or just rely on show conn?, No problem, glad I could help. As far as I know the ""sh conn"" is the command used to view the current connections the ASA knows about and what the state of the connection is. You may have seen this doc but if you haven't it's a good overview of the TCP state entries and the meanings of the various flags etc.- http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/113602-ptn-113602.html Jon]",[4],1,2015-10-13,12629946,0,7,"Hi All, I have just been investigating an issue on ASA for the past couple of hours. Basically I have a static nat from outside interface to inside interface on port 5000. Outside interface = 1.1.1.1 Inside interface = 192.168.1.1 Nat rule Pat for any address from 192.168.1.0/24 to interface 1.1.1.1 Static nat for 1.1.1.1 on port 5000 to map to 192.168.1.1 5000 This should work as long as relevant outside acl is applied which was and I could see the packet passing through all hoops and getting denied on the inside acl in outbound direction rather than inboud!

However, if you have AnyConnect 4.x licenses realize that there is (currently) not any technical enforcement of the number of concurrent users. When you install an AnyConnect 4.x activation key, your ASA will indicate it has up to the maximum allowed by the platform hardware for the number of available licenses. They did this to account for the fact that it is now technically licensed per unique user and not per unique connection (i.e. one user with PC, tablet and mobile phone connections running simultaneously counts as one license)., Hi Marvin, thanks for following up here.  As far as I've understood the device specificmaximum number of VPN sessions still count. We plan to scale the solution according to an average count of connected clients, butit would be nice to give precedence to a group of users in case the device limit is reached. Do you know if there's anything on the road map for this kind of prioritization?, You're welcome Jorn. Yes- the device-specific (hardware) maximums still apply. The vast majority of customers operate well below that; but if such is not the case in your environment you could run into issues of there being no more available remote access VPN connections. I've not heard of any roadmapto add the feature you're asking about. I would suggest that if it's a critical business need, you could look into adding a small second ASA that's reserved for the critical users. The new AC licenses can be used across multiple devices, each operating withing its hardware limits. As long as you're licensing for unique users, you are legitimate with respect to the purchased licenses., Very well, we will adhere to the given limitations and advise the customer to scale properly.

So the source IPs are translated but then they do not match the crypto map acl and are not sent down the VPN tunnel. It looks like you do have a correct NAT statement on the ASA 5505 so just copy that but obviously flip the IP subnets around. Does that make sense? Jon, Thanks Jon- we thought we found a dup line in ACL and removed then neither host could ping each other. Ran packet tracer again and found the same results where the local IP is being translated to Firewall IP? We'll keep looking at the ACL's..., Scott Just to clarify, do you have something like this(using your objects)- ""nat (inside,outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 destination static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.54.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.54.0_24 no proxy-arp route-lookup"" on your ASA 5512? Because you need it so that your IPs do not get translated to the outside interface IP. Obviously you also need to define the objects referenced. It looks like you have this on the other firewall (with the subnets reversed). Jon, Hi Jon-  Yes- we have that rule(in BOLD) along with others on the 5512 and on 5505(only one tunnel on this device)...  5512# sh run nat nat (inside,outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 destination static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.53.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.53.0_24 no-proxy-arp route-lookup nat (inside,outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.10.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.10.0_24 destination static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.53.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.53.0_24 no-proxy-arp route-lookup nat (inside,outside) source dynamic obj-0.0.0.0 interface nat (inside,outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 destination static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.54.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.54.0_24 no-proxy-arp route-lookup  5505# sh run nat nat (inside,outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.54.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.54.0_24 destination static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 no-proxy-arp route-lookup! object network obj_any nat (inside,outside) dynamic interface! nat (inside,outside) after-auto source dynamic any interface, Okay I think it is a NAT ordering issue. Basically that static NAT and this rule- nat (inside,outside) source dynamic obj-0.0.0.0 interface are both in section 1 and in that section it is done on the order of the rules so it is matching the dynamic NAT rule rather than the static because that looks to be higher up in the order. To check just run a ""sh nat"" and this will show you what order everthing is in. The ASA works it's way through the sections. You also have this- nat (inside,outside) after-auto source dynamic any interface which is doing the same thing as the first statement but is in section 3 so it is never used. So you can do one of two things- 1) configure the static NAT statement to be above the dynamic NAT in section 1 ie. you can specify the line ordering or 2) remove the dynamic NAT from section 1 and then your ASA will use the entry in section 3. There is a very good document on this site for NAT and the recommendation is to use section 3 for your general purpose dynamic NAT precisely because of these issues. Interestingly on your ASA 5505 you have duplicated your dynamic NAT statements again but this time with section 2 and section 3 statements which is why your static NAT is working because it is matched before any of your dynamic rules. The one thing I am not sure of is you remove the dynamic NAT statement in section 1 and rely on the section 3 statement whether it tears down current connections (sorry can't remember). So you may simply want to reorder so your static NAT is above it just to see if it works. Just in case you want to see the document here is the link- https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/132066/asa-nat-83-nat-operation-and-configuration-format-cli Jon, Excellent- thanks Jon!  Yes- ordering- I ran into this in the past. I just removed the dynamic nat and re-added...not sure if that affects the current tunnel?  Either way routing is better now- not headed out internet- uses tunnel & hits other ASA now. Hope this is not asking too much but we are stil lrookies and wonder how we can keep or tunnel up and have always used scripts to keep a piing going from the initiator side- can't the responder start the tunnel? Can this line help us? isakmp keepalive threshold 10 retry 2  Thanks again. -SP, Scott Yes the NAT on 8.3 onwards can be quite tricky:-) Glad you got it working. If both ASAs have static public IPs on their outside interfaces then either side should be able to bring up the VPN. Do they have static IPs and are you saying you can'tbring up the tunnel from either side? Jon, Thanks for the doc link too.  Yep- we have static IP on 5512 but only a static DHCP on 5505 for testing I think... What we always have to do is ping from a host on a specific or ""one"" side of the tunnel- the initiator side...example below on ASA 5505:  IKEv1 SAs:  Active SA: 1  Rekey SA: 0 (A tunnel will report 1 Active and 1 Rekey SA during rekey) Total IKE SA: 1 1 IKE Peer: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX  Type: L2L Role: initiator  Rekey: no State: MM_ACTIVE  On the 5512-it's tunnel has the ""responder""... 2 IKE Peer: XX.XXX.XX.XXX  Type: L2L Role: responder  Rekey: no State: MM_ACTIVE  How do we keep a tunnel up or start a tunnel from both sides? Thanks. -SP, It depends what you mean by static DHCP IP. If the IP is obtained via DHCP then it can change so often you cannot initiate the connection to an ASA with a DHCP IP because you don't know what the peer IP is. But obviously you can initiate the connection from the ASA with the DHCP IP because it does know the peer IP of the ASA with the static IP. But if you can guarantee the IP will always be the same then you should be able to initiate from either side. It really depends on whether your 5512 has a peer IP for the 5505 firewall. If it doesn't there is a way to get it to work I believe using dynamic DNS (and possibly certificates) but I have never done that so can't be much help. In terms of keeping the tunnel up isakmp keepalives won't do that. I did a quick internet search and found a few threads that talk about setting the vpn session timeout etc. but even then some were saying it didn't work. One of the other methods suggested was simply to use something like IP SLA to send a ping at regular intervals ie before the tunnel times out to keep it up and this may be an approach you could use. Sorry I can't be more help but it's not something I have ever had to do. Jon, The DHCP static remains the same from a pool...and should not change- I think- so far using ATT DSL modem's for testing and also provides a backup solution for our failover when needed. Makes sense- I appreciate the detailed response about timeouts/keep-alives. We'll stick to pings I suppose- since our tunnel traffic is erratic and for some reason is not initiated by data transfer or server communication that we know of... though we have to ping from one side to initiate the tunnel- that is why we asked about both sides. Strange how it can only be from one side...any other ideas as to how this strange issue could happen? Again- appreciate your knowledge on subject.-SP, On the 5512 do you have a peer IP address specified for the remote end of the VPN tunnel? If you do then then only thing I can think of is that an acl on one of the firewalls is blocking the connection from one side but not the other. Like I say if both sides know about each other's public IP then both sides should be able to initiate the connection. I am logging off for the night but I will check in again with this thread. Ifboth peers do know each other's IPs it could be something else on the firewalls so I'm happy to try and work it through with you if you want to. Jon, I just cleared the tunnel on the 5505 and try to initiate connection from a host off 5512 (1.79) and it keeps getting ping timeouts...?  5505# clear crypto isakmp sa 5505# clear crypto ipsec sa 5505# sh isakmp sa There are no IKEv1 SAs There are no IKEv2 SAs  5512#sh isakmp sa There are no IKEv1 SAs There are no IKEv2 SAs  C:\>ping-t 192.168.54.20 Pinging 192.168.54.20 with 32 bytes of data: Request timed out.

Sorry to keep bothering you- just not sure why this is occurring? -SP, Scott I actually have a spare half hour so lets try and get this sorted.

If so I suggest youbring the tunnel down on both ends and then try pinging from the 5512 side and see if it brings the tunnel up. Probably some of your pings will time out while the tunnel is brought up. Then bring the tunnel down again and ping from the other side just to make sure. As you are using peer IPs on both sides I can't see why it wouldn't work. Like I say I have a bit of spare time so if you run the tests then come back here I should be around. Jon, No worries- appears the tunnel comes up does come up from 5512 side- but takes a bit longer- more pings than from the other side(5505)- here are the results.

159,159,george.tsanava,"[user1, asker, user2, asker, asker, user2]","[Look into NHRP holdtimes and registration timers. The default values are quite long., registration timer is 30 seconds, holdtime is 60 seconds, on all routers., Hi George, I can think of two possible event that would explain the behavior you're experiencing. a) DMVPN state change. b) Change in the routing table. You can troubleshoot each of the above issue to identify which one is causing the problem, and then isolate it. For starters, you should make sure that the DMVPN remain in a stable 'up' state.  You mention "" pokes displays that tunnels to HUB1 are in nhrp state""--- This confirmDMVPN is 'stuck' and not fully operational. I can suggest that you review some useful troubleshooting details here: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/dynamic-multipoint-vp...   Have a look at these details: ~~~ Interface: Tunnel100, IPv4 NHRP Details Type:Spoke, NHRP Peers:2, # Ent Peer NBMA Addr Peer Tunnel Add State UpDn Tm Attrb -----------------------------------------------------   1 192.168.1.1 172.28.1.1  UP  1d21h   S   1 192.168.1.2 172.28.1.2  UP  1d21h   S ~~~ You will see similar output in your setup, so you would want to keep an eye on the ""UpDn"" time, as it will tell you how long the DMVPN has been up. If the DMVPN remain stable while you're experiencing the problem, then focus on troubleshooting the routing protocol you're using across the dmvpn tunnel. If the DMVPN is unstable, verify connectivity between the spoke and hub NBMA address, and ensure connectivity remain stable. you can use 'debug dmvpn error crypto and debug dmvpn errornhrp"" to help identifying the problem if it is DMVPN related.   There are a lot of assumption in my suggestions, because you have not posted the configuration:). But it would help if you post the config. Best of luck with your efforts.

I have 2 objects (mgmt server and Prime) part of the internal 10.57.254.0 subnet.

Am I right in assuming I need to clear the object NATS for the servers and just leave the NO-NAT for the VPN Thanks, So after clearing the nats for those servers I now get the following output from the packet trace.

164,164,shinakuma123,"[user1, asker, user1]","[Just seen your PM. You need to NAT the subnet at your end so- object network LOCAL_NET_REAL subnet 10.20.105.0 255.255.255.0 object network LOCAL_NET_NAT subnet 10.10.106.0 255.255.255.0 object network REMOTE_NET subnet 10.96.0.0 255.255.0.0 nat (inside,outside) source static LOCAL_NET_REAL LOCAL_NET_NAT destination static REMOTE_NET REMOTE_NET you can use any names for the objects you like. Then your crypto map acl needs to reference the NAT range ie. 10.10.106.0/24 and not the real IPs. Jon, Hi Jon Thank you!! Last questions,you said to reference the NATT'd range in the crypto ACL when defining theinteresting traffic, however their is also an ACL on the L3 svi on the firewall for this subnet, do you reference the real IP's here or the Natt'd range? Also there is other NATs for the real subnet configured on the firewall, for example for that range to NAT out to public ip on outside interface, will this NAT statement affect the other NATs in place? i dont want any other NATs to break, and does the positioning of this NAT matter? does it have to be placed higher than the other nats for this subnet?, You only reference the NAT range in your crypto map because the ASA does the translation so anything internal to the ASA sees the real IPs. The positioning does matter. You want this NAT statement to be before your general NAT statement for the same IP subnet.

167,167,jimmydharia,"[user1, asker, user1, asker]","[Hello, Yes, all people in remote location will be able to connect to Central Office with AnyConnect client, even if they have the single public IP address. That is so, because different sessions from different AnyConnect clients will have different source TCP ports. What about IPsec and old Cisco VPN Clients? The situation should be the same, because Cisco VPN Clients are behind NAT. So, they will have to use NAT-traversal and use UDP 4500 to encapsulate ESP session. And in UDP there will also be used different source port numbers., Than you that is what my understanding was too unless they have configured the following setting within the ASA Implementing NAT-Assigned IP to Public IP Connection In rare situations, you might want to use a VPN peerâs real IP address on the inside network instead of an assigned local IP address. Normally with VPN, the peer is given an assigned local IP address to access the inside network. However, you might want to translate the local IP address back to the peer-s real public address if, for example, your inside servers and network security is based on the peerâs real IP address. Cisco ASA 55xx introduced a way to translate the VPN clientâs assigned IP address on the internal/protected network to its public (source) IP address. This feature supports the scenario where the target servers/services on the internal network and network security policy require communication with the VPN clientâs public/source IP instead of the assigned IP on the internal corporate network. You can enable this feature on one interface per tunnel group. Object NAT rules are dynamically added and deleted when the VPN session is established or disconnected. Limitations Because of routing issues, we do not recommend using this feature unless you know you need it. Â· Only supports legacy Cisco VPN client (IKEv1) and AnyConnect clients. Â· Return traffic to the public IP addresses must be routed back to the ASA so the NAT policy and VPN policy can be applied. Â· Only supports IPv4 assigned and public addresses. Â· Multiple peers behind a NAT/PAT device are not supported. Â·Does not support load balancing (because of routing issue). Â·Does not support roaming., Cool:) I have not used this feature before! Of cource, with this feature enabled, multiple peers behind NAT/PAT can not be used. Why they have enabled this feature? From my point of view it is much easier to create a special pool of IP-addresses (not from local subnet), and assign those IP-addresses to VPN Clients. In this way everything should work fine..., ) Noidea why they are using this feature but I do agree with you that a separate VPN pool of IP addresses is the way to go to. Thank you for your quick response.]",[0],1,2015-09-16,12607971,1,4,"As far as I know the VPN clients(anyconnect or ipsec) or the firewalldoesn't have a restriction that every client that connects and establishes a VPN sessionshould have a unique public ip address.

The ASA_Receiving output shown is from it. The ""There are no isakmp sas"" message means that the receiving ASA isn't even receiving the first setup message, right? I'll send the capout output when I get the chance., yeah but the more accurate way to verify if the udp 500 packet is coming to ASA or not is by applying captures., I ran the captures. The receiving ASA_Receiving wasn't getting any udp packets, as expected, however the ASA_Initiator was only sending udp packets on port 364, not on 500.  1: 15:08:16.675334 802.1Q vlan#989 P0 199.48.156.xx.xx > 71.13.171.xx.xx: udp 364 2: 15:08:24.914061 802.1Q vlan#989 P0 199.48.156.xxx.xxx > 71.13.171.xxx.xxx: udp 364 etc... more of the same, udp 364 is the packet size of 365. the port number will be seen likethis: 1.1.1.1:500>2.2.2.2:500 do you see port 500 in the initiator's capture?, Yes I do, so the packets aren't making it to the other side.

180,180,RolandoValenzuela,"[user1, user2, user1, user3, user1, user3, user2, user1, user3, user1, user1, user2, user3]","[Any suggestions?, The Internet access depends- do you want them to use their local Internet or the main site Internet connection? Which networks they can get to at the main office is generally set via an access-list which is referenced by the following commandson the ASA's group policy: split-tunnel-policy tunnelspecified split-tunnel-network-list value &lt;access-list name> Which LDAP server you use is generally set via creating an LDAP server (or server group) and referencing it via: authentication-server-group &lt;group name>...in the tunnel-group section., Thank you both! At least I know what to look for now! @Marvin checking the ACL applied to the split-tunnel configuration not it is obvius why is not working, only two subnets were allowed. ASA01# show run | i split-tunne access-list split-tunnel standard permit 10.10.0.0 255.255.0.0 access-list split-tunnel standard permit 10.20.0.0 255.255.0.0 split-tunnel-policy tunnelspecified split-tunnel-network-list value split-tunnel  @pjain2, regarding your second option, if I need a internet service that can only be reached by USA networks (as an example lets say HBOplus) can I include that subnets or FQDN in the ACL and allow that traffic to the corporate link or is all or nothing?  I will try to make some adjustments and let you know the results!:D Thank you!! Rolando Valenzuela., Hey Ronaldo, Is this what you mean: you need internet access from 10.10.0./16 and 10.20.0.0/16 i.e. your internal networks? Regards, No, lets say I travel to Japan and I want to see HBOplus, can I force that particular traffic to uses the VPN (USA IP) and all the rest of the traffic (like facebook, google, bing, outlook, etc etc) dont?  Thanks again!, to do that, you need to allow the public ip address of that Website HBOplus in the split tunneling acl on the ASA, only then will that traffic go over the vpn, While pjain2 is technically correctly, in practice HBOplus (and most every every other major streaming service) uses a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to stream their service from many different locations. The addresses for a given streaming service will change according to where the DNS request comes from geographic location. Theywill also change over time as the CDN adds or removes nodes., Valid point Marvin:) but I just said HBOplus to say something familiar for everybody, I couldn't say the name of our internal apps since nobody know them, and for security reason:)  FYI- I was able to changed the LDAP authentication:D but for some reason I can connect to the VPN, but I cannot reach any internal network, I just trying to fix that before editing the ACL.  Regards. Rolando Valenzuela., Hey Ronaldo, if access to your internal networks is not working through vpn, check if the nat exemption is configured on the ASA for the traffic  Regards, awesome catch pjain2! I enabled source ""any"" destination ""internal_subnets"" so far, I will tight up source address later but now it is working.  Thank you both for all the help!! I will keep testing today and probably next week to see what doesn't work, but the most critical part is there:D  Thanks again!! Rolando Valenzuela., Hi guys, After all your help everything works really fine!:) just one thing! while on the VPN I cannot reach the firewall itself.  What I'm doing to hit the firewall while using the VPN is to login to a router and the use the command ssh to connect to the firewall.  Thanks again for all the help!, The first two things I would check are: Have you allowed the VPN pool address range to ssh? Have you included the ASA interface subnet in your NAT exemption to the VPN pool?, Hey Ronaldo, To be able to access internet after connecting through anyconnect vpn, you have 2 options: 1. Either send all the traffic including the internet traffic through the vpn. for this you just have to configure dynamic nat for the vpn pool subnet: object network &lt;name> subnet &lt;pool subnet> &lt;mask> nat (outside*,outside*) dynamic interface------>* refers to the interface on which the anyconnect vpn is terminating. 2. Or you can send traffic for your specific internal subnets through the tunnel and the internet traffic will not go through the vpn tunnel: group-policy &lt;name1> internal group-policy &lt;name1> attributes split-tunnel-policy tunnelspecified split-tunnel-network-list value split the access-list for the split-tunnel would be configured as: access-list split standard permit &lt;subnet> &lt;mask> Here the &lt;subnet> refers to the internal subnets that you need to access via vpn. tunnel-group &lt;name> general-attributes default-group-policy &lt;name1>]","[1, 12]",1,2015-09-01,12596151,0,13,"Good day community!

I want to check sysopt connection permit-vpn  Explain, please, how you test VPN. To establish theVPN tunnel, you need to generate interesting traffic. So, for example, you need to ping from net 192.168.0.0/24 (SG) some host on 192.168.2.0/24 (MK) or vice a verse. Be sure, that packets from 192.168.0.0/24 reach the inside interface of ASA SG when they have destination address from 192.168.2.0/24. Be sure, that packets from 192.168.2.0/24 reach the inside interface of ASA MK. To check, if packets reach the interface, you can use packet capture. For example, on ASA SG: capture TEST interface inside match ip 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 show capture TEST, Hi Boris,  Thank you for to try to figure out the problem.

According to ping issue, my suggestion is to check, if some type of host-basedfirewall on Computers from both sides isblocking ICMP-queries. Anyway, you can still use packet capture on inside interfaces of both ASAs, to check, if ICMP traffic is reaching the ASA.  Also, you can try to enable ICMP inspection: policy-map global_policy class inspection_default inspect icmp inspect icmp-error]",[7],1,2015-08-31,12594671,1,8,"Hellow Everyone.

182,182,sasha@impcomputers.com,"[user1, user1, user1, user2, user1, user2, user1]","[Hello, Sasha. Very strange situation. Try to use: show asp drops on ASA2, while ASA1 is initiating the tunnel. Issue this command several times and try to find out, what counters are increasing., Also,try to use on ASA2 debug crypto ikev1 127 debug crypto ipsec 127 terminal monitor, And one more idea:) May be you have something like this on ASA2: access-group outside_access_in in interface outside control-plane? By control-plane keyword in access-group sentence, the traffic, which is destinated to ASA's interface, can be dropped. Please, see the following discussion: https://supportforums.cisco.com/discussion/11130691/access-group-control-plane-cisco-pixasa, Thanks for your ideas, but:- We've already tried asp drops (I mentioned it in my first post)- We use debug crypto etc., but the traffic gets dropped before it is passed to IKE process- nothing is displayed by that debugs except when the flow already exists- We don't have control-plane option in the access-group command Thanks anyway:-), Could you, please, post the whole config from bothASAs? Could you, please, post the output ofshow ver from both ASAs?, Problem solved when I created new ACL and new incoming access group on outside interface with control-plane option. Looks like packets destined for ASA must have that option to be processed!?! Boris, thanks a lot, you gave me inspiration for this! Best regards., Great news! But the solution is still not clear for me too:) Usually, you don't have to use control-plane option.

subnet is going out through the vpn., Can't do a capture, but when I do a route print, the default route out is the VPN adapter, and the 172.16 network is my Ethernet adapter. So that's the wrong way round! But how can I change it? It shouldn't be doing that., if you are connecting to a WiFi network, can you change the modem's settings to hand out a different private ip subnet range to your ethernet adapter. alternatively, you can also use ""tunnel all"" and disable local lan access so that by default all traffic including the internet traffic will gothrough the vpn., I am using a wired connection from home.

As per QUESTION 2, I did not know about the new AnyConnect Licensing scheme:  http://www.petenetlive.com/KB/Article/0001013.htm As I understand from that link, you should buy a Plus Licence (analogous to the Essential one), choosingthe duration: Let's say: L-AC-PLS-1YR-G for1 year, or L-AC-PLS-P-G for perpetual and then you should buy the license for the amount of clients you have: AC-PLS-P-5-S for 5 of them. Is that right? As per QUESTION 5, do you know the command to change the ARP timeout on ASA? Kind Regards, PEDRO, You are right for anyConnect 4. The main difference to old licensing is that you have to count the users that needs AnyConnect installed. Not the users that use it simultaneously. But the minimumuser count is 25 users to my knowledge. But also for twenty-five users and five year subscription you typically pay less then for AnyConnect Essentials and AnyConnect Mobile together. The order codes for that combination would be (you need both): L-AC-PLS-5YR-G AC-PLS-5YR-25-S The arp timeout can be changed with the command... (drum roll) ""arp timeout""!;-), Hi Karsten, Thanks very much for your help. It is much appreciated to clarify concepts. Just a quick question: You say "" The main difference to old licensing is that you have to count the users that needs AnyConnect installed. Not the users that use it simultaneously."" Do you know how it is done? I mean, you could download AnyConnect 4 attacking the ASA, and that way it is easy to count the different users using AnyConnect. Butyou could also download AnyConnect 4 from the internet, so how does ASA keep track of the number of different users connected to it?, It's notthe ASA that countsthe users. You count them and Cisco trusts you that you buythe right amount of AnyConnect licenses. Probably Cisco will change that sometime in the future and add a technical control for that. But now, that's the way it works., Hi Karsten, I was thinking about 5 AnyConnect licenses, so 25 are more than enough for me. Justa an extra question about licensing: Let's say I would like to upgrade from 10 to 50 users for the Base License. If I get the L-ASA5505-10-50 Upgrade License, I understand I will receive it via email, as all ASA licenses starting with capital L are to be received through email. And upon receipt, I will have to register that License on Cisco website in order to activate it. And finally I will introduce the code on the ASA via CLI or ASDM. Is that right?, That's right. You'll receive a PAK. This PAK is used together with the serial number of the ASA to request the activation-key at www.cisco.com/go/license. The activation-key is then added to the ASA., Hi Karsten, And I assume the same procedure applies to the AnyConnect Plus Licenses for 5 years that you recommended me above: L-AC-PLS-5YR-G  and  AC-PLS-5YR-25-S  I mean, I will receive a PAK and I have to request the activation-key, as explained in this link, right? http://www.petenetlive.com/KB/Article/0000531.htm  â, it's exactly as shown there., Hi Karsten, I assume both licenses will be forwarded by email, in spite of one starting by capital L but not the other one, right?  L-AC-PLS-5YR-G  and  AC-PLS-5YR-25-S, In fact, it's just one license. So yes, you'll get one mail with a link to activate the license., Hi Karsten, If it's just one license, which one should I apply for?, The order will include both items, but out of that order you get one license., You mean that a will get a single PAK and with that I will have to follow the procedure of this link:  http://www.petenetlive.com/KB/Article/0000531.htm Is that right?, Yes, it's really that easy!, Hi Karsten, I remember you said AnyConnect Plus Licenses apply for AnyConnect 4, which I have it implemented in Windows machines, but I have AnyConnect 3.1.01587 for OS X machines. Therefore, will I be able to use AnyConnect Plus Licenses with AnyConnect 3.1?, With the AnyConnect 4 license you still can use the AC 3.x client. But AC4 is also available for MacOS, you can upgrade to AC4., Hi Karsten, Just with a quick search I have learnt there is the new AnyConnect 4 version for OSX: Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility 4.1.02011 I will upgrade it and go for the AnyConnect Plus License. Thanks very much for your help!, Hi Karsten, I just came across another doubt: Is there any difference between L-ASA5505-10-50 and ASA5505-SW-10-50? I assumethe first one being email delivered, but what doesthe-SW- mean?, Hi Karsten, I will try to answer myself: Is  L-ASA5505-10-50  an eDelivery SKU  and  ASA5505-SW-10-50  a Physical SKU? So the only difference is the way they are sent to the customer?, Hi Karsten, Just another question: regarding clientless SSL VPNs:- if you have a Basic License, allowing just 2 SSL VPN peers, are they unlimited by default, or the 2 SSL VPN peers limit applies to both, client-based and clientless?- if both client-based and clientless share the SSL VPN limit, when upgrading the AnyConnect Plus License for 25 users, does it also apply for clientless connections or is there any special license to enlarge the number of clientless SSL VPN connections?, > Is  L-ASA5505-10-50  an eDelivery SKU  >and  ASA5505-SW-10-50 a Physical SKU? yes, that's right. >- if you have a Basic License, allowing just 2 SSL VPN peers, are they unlimited by default, or the 2 SSL VPN peers limit applies to both, client-based and clientless? Both AnyConnect and clientless is limited. >- if both client-based and clientless share the SSL VPN limit, when upgrading the AnyConnect Plus License for 25 users, does it also apply for clientless connections or is there any special license to enlarge the number of clientless SSL VPN connections? The Plus license is not for clientless. If you need AnyConnect and also clientless, you need to buy the APEX license., Hi Karsten, As per the 2 SSL VPN peers allowed by default in a Basic License, I supposed this number comes from adding up client-based and clientless connections. I mean, you could have up to 2 AnyConnect sessions, or 2 https sessions or 1 of each type, but not having more than 2 connections adding up both kinds. Is that the case?, > Is that the case? Yes, 2 is the limit for AnyConnect and clientless combined., Hi Karsten, That's what I wanted to confirm. Thanks very much. And regarding the new Plus Licenses, I guess they are ready to be inserted into the ASA5505 hardware-bundle, right? I am telling you this because I get in touch with a seller and I was told they were not aware of L-AC-PLS-5YR-G  and  AC-PLS-5YR-25-S  licenses but they did about L-ASA-AC-E-5505=  If I used L-ASA-AC-E-5505= in order to get 25 SSL VPN users, do you think it would make any difference instead of using L-AC-PLS-5YR-G  and  AC-PLS-5YR-25-S ?, AnyConnect Essentials is announced EOS, you shouldn't buy them any more!, Hi Karsten, I see L-AC-PLS-5YR-G  and  AC-PLS-5YR-25-S  licenses are the good ones in order to get 25 AnyConnect users. And I must ask for both to the seller, right?, Hi Karsten, Thanks very much for your help. Now I feel ready to order those licenses.

Hence, the tunnel would always be initiated from the spoke. please see the below document for further explanation: When the spoke router starts up, it automatically initiates the IPsec tunnel with the hub router as described above.

You are on the right path by modifying the preferences.xml but this will get override once the configuration is pushed from the ASA. Thus, you can edit the client profile form the ASA and then you would not need to make changes on the client. Please make sure the new certificate is not only installed, it is also applied on the outside interface. Make sure you remove the older command and add it with correct trustpoint (which has the new certificate) no ssl trust-point &lt;trustpoint name of old certificate> outside ssl trust-point &lt;trustpoint name of new certificate> outside For modifying the client profile:- Go to Configuration> Remote Access VPN > Anyconnect Profile > Name the profile.

Add the string: access-list 102 permit icmp any any   And what about VPN. I think that now the problem is that R2 doesn't have a route to network behind ASA (10.0.1.0/24). Please, check on R2 show ip route 10.0.1.0  If so, add a static route on R2, please ip route 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0172.30.2.1, Hello Boris, After to apply of the changes that you write me the problem continuous.

It seems, that RIP can not work between routers, because, ACL 102 on R2 blocks RIP-updates., So I have to change the protocol rip on the R2 or only delete the network 172.30.0.0?, If RIP is not very neccessary for you, just try to add default route to R2: ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.2.1 If you want to use RIP very much, add permissions to ACL 102: access-list 102 permit udp any any eq 520, Hello Boris, The ping is working. tunnel between ASA and R2 is successful. Very thanks for help me to resolve the problem. And I have a debt, Is it possible create a VPN without use of IPec? Another time very thanks., I'm glad, that we have resolved the issue! VPN is a common termwhich combinesmany diffenent technologies. There are very many protocols, which can be used to create VPNs. Among them are IPsec, GRE, VTI, DMVPN, L2TP, PPTP and many many others. The technology, called GRE, can be used to build VPN between cisco Routers. And GRE VPN is not encrypted. You can find very much information about how to configure GRE on cisco Routers in google. For examle: https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/13576/how-configure-gre-tunnel But ASA doesn't support GRE. ASA can build VPNs, using IPsec, L2TP. Also, ASA can build VPNs for remote access (when a user need to connect to central office from remote localtion with his own PC, laptop, mobile phone) using SSL technology. In this case, VPN can be built by client-software (Cisco Anyconnect secure mobility client) or event with clientless method (just with web-browser)., Hello Boris.

197,197,murali438,"[user1, user2]","[Murali As far as I understand it the feature basically allows you to have multiple IPSEC tunnels and the traffic within the tunnel ie. the source and destination IPs of the end devices can be in different VRFs. So it works primarily with MPLS VPNs ie. if you had multiple MPLS VPNs each with their own VRF you could then run ISPEC tunnels across the MPLS network and when the packets are received they are automatically in the correct VRF. You couldn't do this normal crypto maps ie. you could still terminate multiple IPSEC tunnels on one public IP but the traffic would then all be in the same global routing table. So the advantage is primarily the same as you get with any VRF setup ie. logical separation of traffic on a single device. Can't really say much about caveats as I have never used it but there are certain restrictions.

203,203,ndp_narni,[user1],"[As a rule of thumb: Whenever userdata needs to be protected, symmetric crypto is used as it's build for this task and is much faster then asymmetric crypto. Asymmetric crypto is not build for protecting bigamounts of data. With that, the IPsec SAs use only symmetric algorithms to protect the data. For Phase 1, it depends on the way authentication is done. If you are using PSKs and router1 wants to authenticate router2, there is the following process involved (slightly simplified): R1 sends a nonce to R2. This is basically a random nummer. R2 takes this nonce,hashes it together with the PSK and sends the result back to R1. R1 uses it's own generated nonce and the PSK and computes also a hash. If the received hash and the local computation are the same, R1 knows that R2 did the computation with the nonce that R1 provided and used the same PSK as R1: R2 is authenticated. In IPsec, these authentication is done mutually, also R2 authenticates R1. No asymmetric crypto is involved when PSKs are used which makes the processing quite fast. If you use digital certificates for authentication (method rsa-sig in the config) then the following happens (even more simplified): R1 sends a nonce to R2. This nonce gets hashed and the hash is encrypted with R2s private key (here we have asymmetric crypto). If a hash gets encrypted with a private key, the result is named a digital signature. The signature is sent back to R1. R1 uses the certificate of R1 to prove the correctness of the signature which is again an asymmetric crypto operation. Before that, the received certificate has to be validated which also involves one ore more asymmetric crypto operations. And the same happens the other way round. With authentication done with digital certificates we have asymmetric crypto. In addition to that, there is also asymmetric crypto involved when DH calculates keymaterial for the session-keys.]",[0],1,2015-08-15,12582356,0,1,I read through few documents and see that IPsec uses asymmetric key cryptography in Phase 1 to create ike SAs and symmetric key cryptography for IPsec SAs which is bulk data.

That's the version I am guessing is the correct one. But the CVE and bug notes state that all versions which have ""0"" as a third numberin their versionare affected (see below). So what I am trying to say is that someone should either correct the typo in the download section or update the bug/CVE notes:) 3.0(0) 3.1(0) 4.0(0) 4.1(0), Martin, C'mon! We're fighting over 0? Literally ""nothing""?!:-) Well the problem comes from how we're numbering releases internally. (Take this with a grain of salt)4011 equals 4011th internal rebuild, problem is that quite often we'll go to 5 digit numbers, I think we've been there with AC 3.1. So some tools will display 04011 and some the same rebuilt as 4011. screen_shot_2015-08-13_at_12.34.28.png Inconsistent, yes, but mostly cosmetic. M., Thanks for the confirmation. Please try to look at it from customer's perspective. Customer downloads version 4.1.04011 assuming there is just an extra 0 and patchesseveral thousandlaptops. Then the vulnerability gets exploited, a case is raised with TAC to get an explanationand the reply thewould be along the lines ""as per the Cisco PSIRT the versions starting4.1.0 are vulnerable"".The case gets closed and the customer needs to go through a fresh patching project. Hopefully that explains why I am being cautious:), Martin,  I wasn't trying to be dismissive, by any means. What I think is that bug toolkit etc guys have made great strides to improve situation- vide reading bug notes for IOS/IOS-XE around 2 years back and compare it now. Are we better, yes, are we good, no. That's probably as much as I can say in a public forum without getting in trouble internally. There's a width and breadth of products all with different numbering and specifics and tools are supposed to handle all of them.:/ M.]",[3],1,2015-08-13,12580666,0,6,"Hello, I have a quick question about the versions of AnyConnect that should be deployed in order to fix bug CSCut93920.

Well, in the future, the fancy thing could be just to use it. I don't expect that AC 3.x get's much more development. Who knows if the with the next changes in Windows10 AC3 will still work? > For the Plus License, its user Based, i.e. 100 Users, Are they Concurrent users or Named Users? They are named users, so with your next example, you need one license with your eight devices. The licensing is done on a trust-basis. Nothing to install to control the licenses. At least not for the moment. I expect that in a couple of years there will be some kind of enforcement for the licensed userbase. I decided for all new deployments to go for AC4 for mainly two reasons: 1) As the Plus-license is quite cheap it typically doesn't cost more then Essentials and Mobile for the first five years. (That's for my deployments, your calculation may vary). 2) It's possible to mix Plus and APEX licenses. Now it is possible to have a couple of hundred AnyConnect users and still give a small amoount of users the possibility to use clientless without having to pay premium for all., Thank you for your reply. It makes sense to go with the Plus in terms of Cost. Will Probably replace the ASA5525 in 10 years anyway, so it would even out for the 100 users. How are the named users maintained? the first 100 Users that Login have a License? Do I have to Enter Valid users somewhere? What if a Employee Leaves, I can disable the Active Directory Account, how do I reclaim the License?  Thanks again!, There's no technical or enforced linkage to the unique named end users at all (at this time). Usernames and their associated accounts (no matter what authentication server is used- the ASA, AD, RSA, etc.) are strictly your ""honor"" that the licensed count isn't being exceeded., Great!

It can do the NAT for you automatically. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/ios-easy-vpn/eprod_qas0900aecd805358e0.html Otherwise if you use DMVPN, then yes, you will need to NAT each LAN to the Tunnel interface IP address. Just treat the Tunnel interface like any other outside IP address. You'll need to use a route-map to match traffic going to the Internet interface and another for traffic going to the Tunnel interface. Something like: ip nat inside source route-map NAT-TUNNEL interface Tunnel0overload ip nat inside source route-map NAT-INTERNET interface Dialer0 overload access-list 105 permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any route-map NAT-TUNNEL permit 10 match ip address 105 match interface Tunnel0! route-map NAT-INTERNETpermit 10 match ip address 105 match interface Dialer0, AH Wow.

It looks like the process created the CSR., The key mentioned early in Pete's posting is the private key I asked about. Who is the CA you are using?

I think I might lose the step 7. In the process to install certificate, I do not find "" Submit the certificate request"". So How can I submit the request?  7, Submit the certificate request to the certificate administrator, who issues the certificate on the server. This can either be through a web interface, e-mail, or directly to the root CA server for certificate issue process., It sounds like you are mixing up procedures for a self-signed certificate and a CA-signed certificate. If you are using an external CA then you follow the procedures in the guides you cited. they are both for external CA certificate request and install. Inherent in that process is generating of the Certificate Signing Request (CSR). That is what you send off tothe CA., After I tried to sendout the CSR, it looks like the CSR is pending there in ASDM. Sending it to CA is what we want, right? if so, how to send it to CA? Thank you., As noted in step 5 of the Cisco procedure, you save the CSR to a text file. That text file needs to be sent to your CA. For a publicCA, it is either via a web portal (most common) or via email. If it's your own internal CA, and you administer it, you might just copy the text onto the CA server's certificate issuing tool.]",[6],1,2015-08-07,12576911,0,7,"Hi In a new ASA, I am trying to install certificate.

For mobile devices (iOS or Android) you are limited to a method such as disabling split tunnel and forcing all their traffic thought your VPN headend which in turn has either a CWS connector or other inspection engine (such as a FirePOWER module or WCCP to an ESA) in place and enabled. The other option for mobile devices is to enforce their security policy via a third party Mobile Device Management (MDM) tool., Thanks Marvin, just a couple of questions, so CWS doesn't manage mobile devices?do I have to configureclient web security profile for anyconnect on ASA? as regard FirePower with split tunnel disabled I believe it applies only to next generetion ASA, while maybeWCCP to IronPort WSA could be feasible. However I still can't understandifother thenWSA physical appliance I also have to buy a user qty license., There are several methods to deploy CWS. Usinga headend ASA is one of the most common ones. You can also pre-deploy manually or using an enterprise endpoint management solution(such as AD GPOs, Microsoft SCCM, Intel LANdesk, etc.), from an ISR G2, from a WSA etc. Here is a page with a feature comparison for the various methods. There are whitepapers for each method at this link. I'm not positive on the answer re WSA licensing when using that method. I believe the users would count as named users in the WSA so they would decrement the license count if using WSA via WCCP., So the common one is creating a ASA CWS connector?Then I should disable split tunnel anyway to be sure all http traffic from workstation/mobile devicesshould be inspectedby ASA CWS connector., You can push all client trafficthrough the ASA (no split-tunnel)and it will redirect to Cisco's scanning towers for inspection.

220,220,batumibatumi,"[user1, asker]","[There is no DMVPN on the ASA. So whatever you configured, it's either not compatible with the ASA or is something other then DMVPN. At least the debug shows that there is EzVPN involved. From the debug it seems that there is no communication on UDP/500 possible between the devices. Perhaps something is blocking that?, Hi Guys,  I just made mistype. I have configured on ASA EzVPN for 4 offices, 3 offices works fine but only on office has trouble. There are Cisco Router 881 in remote offices. I did the same configuration for all offices but only one office is not working. The output i wrote above.

222,222,talaltk@yahoo.com,"[user1, user2, user1, user2, user1, user2, user1]","[They only need the Apex license if they want clientless SSL VPN or things like Advanced Endpoint Assessment,Posture Assessment, etc.. For AnyConnect full client SSL VPN (as a replacement for the old IPSec VPN client), the Base Plus (edit) license is fine. Both include Mobile as well. Also, both are term-based (1, 3 or 5 years). So for 1-year term, the ""L-AC-PLS-1YR-G"" top level SKU with associated line items is what you'd need. The list price on that is a good bit less as well., So basically what I posted is correct, he needs 5 ssl vpn licenses and he is getting 25 with Apex which is the minimum I can offer. Also he'll need to upgrade to anyconnect 4.x.  Your right list price is a lot cheaper but its on subscription base, so in the long run they'll make money off it. THanks, They shouldn't need the Apex-based SKU, only Plus. The full order detail for 1 year 25 users of AnyConnect Plusis: L-AC-PLS-1YR-G Cisco AnyConnect 1-Yr Plus Subscription License Group AC-PLS-1YR-25-S Cisco AnyConnect 1-Yr 25 User Plus License AC-PLS-1YR-25 Cisco AnyConnect 1-Yr 25 User Plus Subscription L-AC-PLS-S-1Y-25 Cisco AnyConnect 1-Yr 25 User Plus (ASA License Key)  That includes SSL VPN. List price is $25 per year. With Plusthey can also opt for a perpetual subscription- list price $165 for 25 users plus $33 per year for Smartnet support. That's top line part number L-AC-PLS-P-G, Yeah but the client wants clientless ssl vpn, so I guess apex license is the correct one. The one I initially proposed. Also i guess instead of cisco vpn Client which they have, they'll need to upgrade to cisco anyconnect secure mobility client., Correct- clientless is only supported on the AnyConnect 4.x Apex license if it's a new purchase. Existing AnyConnect 3.x Premium licenses (now end of sales) will also support clientless. The end user experience for clientless will be different than with a full tunnel (IPsec or SSL VPN) as they will only get services that can be exposed via a browser natively or via a plug-in., I tried to give my client a anyconnect premium license but my local cisco distributor is saying end of sales, even though end of sales is August 31st. So that gives me no option to purchase the apex license and upgrade his current any connect 3 to 4.x, Yes- once we're down to the last couple of months in a product's lifecycle approaching end of sales hard cutoff they require the partner to submit special justification why we are selling an almost-obsolete product. Overall it's intended to increase customer satisfaction since most would be unhappy to buy something only to find out a month later (often before they've even installed it) that it's already discontinued.]",[4],1,2015-08-04,12573476,1,7,"Hi Experts, My client has VPN client version 5.0.07.0440.

He asked about routes on the 5515 and the original poster responded about routes on the 5505.  So let us focus on the 5515 and the network connected to it. I have two specific questions.- is there a route on the 5515 for the LAN subnet of the remote 5505 (which might be 192.168.7.0)and does that route point to the interface where the crypto map is applied?- in the network connected behind the 5515 (and the original VPN head end) what is the routing for the network at the remote site (which might be 192.168.7.0) and is the next hop for that routing the 5515 or is it still the original VPN headend?  HTH  Rick, Ok, on the 5515 there is a default route out for all networks, route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 (next hop IP)so this would cover the return traffic. And I have a route on the ASA for the inside which is 172.16.0.0 255.254.0.0 this is all I need isn't it? Appreciate your help guys., I asked two specific questions. You answered only the first one. So please tell us about the routing of the network behind the ASA. Perhaps one way to do this is to perform tracert from a PC in the head end network to an address in the LAN at the remote. Does the traceroute go through the 5515 or does it go through the other head end VPN device?  HTH  Rick, Hi Richard, I answered both. question 1. There is a default route out of the ASA on the outside interface. question 2. There is a route to the inside network 172.16.0.0 on the inside interface.  there is no specific route to 192.168.7.0 as I thought this would follow the default route out, the crypto map is applied to the outside interface. i am unable to do a trace to the remote site as only phase 1 of the tunnel comes up, so I had to put the ASA on its older connection which works. I can try this tomorrow though.  do you think I need to make an implicit route to the 192.168.7.0 network?, Phase: 3 Type: NAT Dynamic translate 172.17.10.1/0 to 81.128.141.106/64164 Looking at packet-tracer, it seems to be translating the source from 172.17.10.1to 81.128.141.106 when sending the packet to 192.168.7.1. Can you confirm if you have the correct nat exempt for this traffic. Please share the natting command used for this side. Regards, Dinesh Moudgil P.S.

Dont we have to define nat our local ip with external ip What is the best way to troubleshoot nat., What Karsten means to say is if you configure two nat statements under object like this, it will have the nat with interface keyword as active nat. You can verify this via ""show run nat "" In case you want to use 99.99.99.99 for the webserver,try removing interface command and add static 99.99.99.99 command listed previously.

For that on the router the crypto-config is needed (where I don't have a sample this moment) and the primary protocol needs to be changed in the AnyConnect profile: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyconnect31/administration/guide/anyconnectadmin31/ac03vpn.html#pgfId-1798377, My Cisco rep recommended that I not try AnyConnect to an ISR router or ASR. So I used an Open Source client. Not saying AnyConnect won't work, just the route that I took on my project. I do have known working good configuration for a 1921 with strongSwan as the Client. This is with IPSEC and IKEV2 using certificates to authenticate., Hi Douglas, Thanks for your response is it possible for you to share the router config, and yes i am having nighmares with Cisco Annyconnect. I just checked StronSwan is for linux which client would you recommend for Windows based machines., I don't have a recommendation for a windows client. All my work is with Linux. I sent a copy of a known working good router configuration with instructions added within the configuration to explain things in response to your private message. Even if it is not exactly what your looking for, it helps to see the structure outside of a Cisco ""how to"" to make that ""how to"" more valuable. I started with Cisco's instructions. I added info about how certificates are handled. Generate the key, create the trustpoint, output the CSR, import the CA Cert, and finally the signed CSR. I hope this helps you along. Not guaranteed to fit your circumstance, just to aid you on your work.  Douglas, Thanks a lot!!!, Hey Douglas,  I came across this thread in my searches. I've been able to successfully establish IPSec / Ikev2 connections using Anyconnect 4.x with Windows. I'm now trying to get it working on linux but I'm not a linux guy. The OS is CENTOS 6 and Anyconnect is installed. I'm assuming that it's not working because the certs are not installed properly? It's note ven attempting to initiate ikev2 connections.   I also just moved over the XML profile in the profile folder from my windows machine into /opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile/  I guess my two questions are. 1.) If you move over a profile.XML file from a windows machine to a linux machine will it still work? Is it compatible between the two OS's without modification? 2.) Is there any documentation out there that gives you step by step instructions with certificates for this procedure? I know I have to do the following: Import CA-Cert Create keys Export CSR and get it signed Import signed certificate., I replied yesterday while I was transiting through the Atlanta Airport but my post failed. I will try to update later today. I have attached a couple files to assist. I don't do AnyConnect to a router. I only support it with an ASA. But getting the trustpoint completed nicely on the router should be a positive step. Also Linux you have to get the certificate store correct. Firefox or local certificate store is supported. I usually run AnyConnect in Linux using Debian or SuSE from command line with local certificate store. Below is my cheat sheet that I keep handy for reference: AnyConnect  To Connect  /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin #./vpn connect asa5515.xxx.ipsec.net (asa5515.xxx.ipsec.net comes from the anyconnect profile called AnyConnectProfile.xml and located /opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile)  To disconnect:  /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin #./vpn disconnect asa5515.xxx.ipsec.net  To Check status:  /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin #./vpn status  To restart Service  /etc/init.d/vpnagentd restart  AnyConnect Profile-> /opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile AnyConnect Local Policy-> /opt/cisco/anyconnect AnyConnect CA Cert-> /opt/.cisco/certificates/ca AnyConnect Machine Cert-> /opt/.cisco/certificates/client AnyConnect Machine Key-> /opt/.cisco/certificates/client/private Attachment: isr_trustpoint.txt anyconnectprofile.txt, Thank you for the cheat sheets.

Which clients do you want to be able to have remote access VPN capability? If it's the ones on your diagram, I can't quite figure out the logic behind that., The goal is to connect from the internet using anyconnect and traverse this network to the individual host IPs using RDP on the bottom of the diagram., OK. breaking the problem down:- can you establish a remote access VPN to the ASA from Internet-based clients?- if you can, do they get the necessary route pushed down for the hosts in the 172.16.100.0/24 network?- if they do, we need to look at the inside of the AS onwards through the SRX.- can the ASA itself reach the target hosts?- if it can, does the same rule on the SRX that allows that also allow the VPN address pool through from the Untrustto Trustzone?, can you establish a remote access VPN to the ASA from Internet-based clients? Yes, however I removed the config - if you can, do they get the necessary route pushed down for the hosts in the 172.16.100.0/24 network? Currently there is only an all zeros to the internet router (not listed) and of course it just has the connected route - if they do, we need to look at the inside of the AS onwards through the SRX. see above - can the ASA itself reach the target hosts? return traffic to the hosts, there is not route on the asa to the hosts itself - if it can, does the same rule on the SRX that allows that also allow the VPN address pool through from the Untrustto Trustzone? this is not configured, You replied telling me about the ASA routes. I was talking about the routes that are pushed to the clients when connected via VPN. That will be represented on the ASA as the access-list namethat is used under the ""split-tunnel-network-list value &lt;access-list name>"" called out by ""split-tunnel-policy tunnelspecified"" in the group policyprofile. The clients will see it on AnyConnect as connected routes. You will need an ASA route to the 172.25.100.0/24 network as well. And likewise those clients need to know how toroute out to the set of addresses assigned to the clients in your VPN pool. That will need to be in place (or included in the default route oftheir gateway)., What should the VPN Pool be? Also the configuration?  Here is where I started.   ip local pool VPN_POOL 192.168.50.1-192.168.50.254 mask 255.255.255.0  webvpn  enable outside  object network NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.50.0_24  subnet 192.168.50.0 255.255.255.0  webvpn  tunnel-group-list enable  anyconnect image disk0:/anyconnect-win-3.1.10010-k9.pkg 1  anyconnect image disk0:/anyconnect-macosx-i386-3.1.10010-k9.pkg 2  anyconnect enable  group-policy GroupPolicy_WebVPN internal  group-policy GroupPolicy_WebVPN attributes  vpn-tunnel-protocol ssl-client  dns-server value 172.27.20.4 172.25.104.16  wins-server none  default-domain value cbfsb.local  exit  tunnel-group WebVPN type remote-access  tunnel-group WebVPN general-attributes  default-group-policy GroupPolicy_WebVPN  address-pool VPN_POOL  tunnel-group WebVPN webvpn-attributes  group-alias WebVPN enable  nat (inside,outside) 13 source static any any destination static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.50.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.50.0_24 no-proxy-arp route-lookup-, OK, so your remote clients will get an address from the address pool 192.168.50.0/24. That subnet is exempted from NAT. Sothat's all good. Does the ASA know how to reach the 172.25.100.0/24 network where the internal hosts are located? Do those hosts or their gateway have a route (default or otherwise) to the 192.168.50.0 pool addresses (i.e. to the ASA)?, Should I make a pool that is from the ASA insides interface? Due to the fact that it is a /20 or what do you recommend?  Not right now.  They would if it is an address range of the inside interface., I tend to define the pool as its own discrete subnet. It can be (even more) confusing when it's carved out of an existing network. Either way will work though as long as they are unique addresses and the places they need to reach know how to route back to them. Having the routing in place is key to making it work. When the ASA is the default gateway for all outbound traffic (i.e. to anywhere on the Internet or otherwise unknown) it's not an issue as the default will take care of it. If that's not the case then we need to account for it in our routing scheme., Okay so now that you know my scenario. What does the ASA config look like?, It depends on how you have configured routing on your ASA. If it's all static routes, then you would need something like: route inside 172.25.100.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.140.198 That tells the ASA how to get to the internal hosts. The L3 Extreme switch and SRX would similarly need routes directing them to the next hop for the VPN pool. The SRX would also need the access policy as I mentioned earlier., What about the split tunnel?, Your configuration didn't have any split-tunnel-policyso the default is no split tunnel. With that in place, all traffic from the clients flows over the VPN when it is active. If you need it then you would add the following in the group policy: split-tunnel-policy tunnelspecified split-tunnel-network-list value vpn_acl access-list vpn_acl extended permit ip 172.25.100.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.50.0 255.255.255.0, Okay thank you. What about the domain name and dns server? I had it listed like this, however when connected the laptop does not get these settings.   group-policy GroupPolicy_AnyConnect_VPN attributes  vpn-tunnel-protocol ssl-client  dns-server value 172.27.105.4 172.25.65.16  wins-server none  default-domain value cisco.local, As you show it, those values should be pushed to connected clients assuming they are connecting to a connection profile (aka tunnel-group) that'susingthat group policy., What protocol do I allow for the devices in front of this? IPSEC? HTTPS?, If there is an upstream firewall you haven't shown, it would need to allow https to the ASA outside interface. The basic AnyConnect-based remote access VPN is SSL. (You can setup IKEv2 IPsec but that's uncommon so far in most installations I've seen.), I allowed DNS (TCP/UDP) and RDP on the SRX in.  I can RDP in, but not by name only by host IP. What do I need to do?, I assume you gave the ASA an inside route for the target hosts. It also needs a route for the VPN clients to get to the DNS servers if they are to resolve addresses. If your internal networks are all from the 172.16.x.x/12 space, then I'd just add a route for that whole section of RFC 1918 space (vs. the earlier one for only the target /24 where the hosts are). i.e.: route inside 172.16.0.0 255.240.0.0 192.168.140.198, Okay that makes sense, I still have to type my domain name before I can rdp  Even with this  default-domain value cisco.local  What do I need to add?, Also is there a way to import the self signed cert that I created so anyconnect doesn't warn me? Or do I just have to buy one?, Regarding the certificate, you can browse to your ASA outside interface and, using yourbrowser's certificate inspection ability, download the certificate to your local host. You can then import that certificate into the Trusted root certificate authority (CA) store (or equivalent on non-windows hosts)and it will be trusted for future connections. This may or may not be feasible per the technological savvy of the end users. For that reason and others, most enterprise deployments elect to use a certificate issues by an established CA. For the domain issue, you need to add your local domain(s) if you want it/them to be prepended to the DNS suffix search list when a VPN connection is established., The DNS is prepended, as far as I can see in ipconfig /all it has the correct domain, however when launching mstsc it is blank.

240,240,showipospf,"[user1, asker, user1, asker, user1, asker, user2]","[Doyou mean the splash page that shows up when you access an ASA to establish a VPN connection? That's a default simple page whose elements are stored in a couple hidden directorieson all ASAs- /+CSCOE+ and /+CSCOU+ for unencrypted and encrypted page elements respectively. They are explained in detail in this document. They can be customized via remote access VPN customization in ASDM but the default pages are not ""copyable"". The customization objects are stored in flash if you have done customization. Generally speaking you cannot simply copy a certificate from one ASA to another without also having the same private key that was used to generate the certificate (if self-signed) or the CSR (if signed by an external CA)., Thank you so much for your reply, Marvin. If the case is ASA to user' PC, instead of ASA to ASA,do you think I can copy the certificate from the ASA to userPC in order for the PC' userto log onto the ASA through https? i guess the answer is no too? ""Doyou mean the splash page that shows up when you access an ASA to establish a VPN connection? ..."" Yes, Certificate does not equal web page. A certificate provides information about the identity of a web page. Whether it is self-signed or issuedby a third party Certificate Authority (CA), you can export and install it on another ASA if you have both the certificate and the private key ofthe original ASA. Here is a document that explains how that is done. Theprivate key is usually the harder part. Unless you specify the key as exportable at creation time, by default it will not be so., Very good explanation! What is relation between private key and certificate in following? "" Whether it is self-signed or issuedby a third party Certificate Authority (CA), you can export and install it on another ASA if you have both the certificate and the private key  ofthe original ASA ""  The private key that you mentioned is identity certificate, right?, The private key is one part of the identity certificate. A certificate itself is signed by the private key of the issuing CA (or, in the case of self-signed, the device). In the case of a CA signing the certificate, the original device private key is linked via the issuance process which includes a certificate and private key that is installed on the server (the ASA here). When secure communications are established, a server (ASA in the case we are discussing)presents the certificate (which includes the the server's public key) as an assertion of identity. Only that server's private key (which is never shared withthe client) can decrypt the return traffic in the secure session that's established.This is ""key"" (pun intended) to the concept of an asymmetric key algorithm. See the Wikipedia article on public-key cryptography for a very complete explanation of that concept. The bottom line is that you need both the certificate and the private key for the server identity to be portable and/or ported to another replacement device. If you're advancing your career in security, you would do well to study and learn PKI concepts. They are key to almost all modern systems that use cryptography(certificates, SSL/TLS, http2, etc.). And yes- it will be on the test., Thank you so much for your excellent explanation and that link!, Certificate comprises of three entities. 1. Certificate body. 2. Private key. 3. Public key. When you create a certificate on your ASA/router, pair of keys (private and public) are generated and private keys are not shared with anyone and public keys are shared with everyone. These keys work in such a way that one key encrypts the data and other decrypts and vice versa. Normally, when you say, you have got the certificate, it encorporates the public key as well. In this case, it states ""you can export and install it on another ASA"", since you created the certificate on previous ASA, the private keys are present there and by default they are not shared. If you need to allow another ASA to encrypt the traffic, it has to be done via private key and thus they state you need to have both the certificate and the private key. Hope this helps.

Finally, this post is useful for us! Please refer this post: http://www.gleescape.com/posts/2917  Thanks, Aswind, Im getting exact the same Errors with the Cisco IPSec VPN Client. Importing the pcf Profil into NCP Secure Entry Client 10.02, the VPN connection is working. Still looking to get he Cisco Client to work, As alternative to Cisco IPSEC VPN client and NCP Secure Entry Client (which costs money) I was able to use Shrew VPN (free version) https://www.shrew.net/download/vpn and importing cisco's pcf profile. That seems to have worked just fine and hopefully can be a usable alternative until if/when Cisco IPSEC VPN client is made to work with Windows 10., Hello Onimallar, I had this same problem with my 64-bit Windows 10. But on my 32-bit Windows 10 VM the Cisco VPN Client worked OK. So I looked into the differences. It seems the 64-bit installer for the VPN client can't modify the network settings to add the required ""DNE LightWeight Filter"" network client to the network adapter properties. I tried the Citrix DNE Updater, and whilst this allowed the Cisco VPN Client to install successfully on my 64-bit machine, it would not establish a connection. Continuing with the differences, I removed both the Cisco VPN Client and the DNE Updater, then installed the SonicWall VPN 64-bit Client from Dell, as this was installed in my 32-bit VM (the 32-bit version). This added the DNE LightWeight Filter network client to my 64-bit machine. I reinstalled the Cisco VPN Client successfully, and was able to connect to a remote site successfully. This worked for me. You can download the SonicWall VPN Client from: https://support.software.dell.com/sonicwall-global-vpn-client/windows%20..., Thanks, this is also working great for me too. downloaded the Sonic Client from http://help.mysonicwall.com/Applications/vpnclient/  (Download possible without account), Good catch, sir.:) Working for me also., This works for me too!

This works for Error 412: Reason 412- The remote peer is no longer responding"" The VPN client goes thru phase1 and phase2 and disconnects in the Securing Communication Channel stage. My company uses a EasyVPN Server running on C887 router. The above solution works great!, I am having the same problem after upgrading to 10.  Lets fix this guys!!! I know the VPN Client isnt supported, but I still use it daily!, Thanks for the fix.

However,referencing this cisco document:- http://goo.gl/XRkrcO, you can see that this command was deprecated in 8.X ASA codes. So the best way to configure bookmarks will be using the ASDM or create them on a server and then bring import them to ASA. Why we can not create bookmarks via CLI? With the introduction of 8.x many more options were added allowing for greater flexibility. Since these new options would make the running configuration unmanagable, as a result they were moved to separate xml files.

Most likely, you might want to check on the remote side if you see the decryptioncounters incrementing in parallelandencryption countersare incrementing or not. On the IOS router, if the encryptcounters are incrementing, then confirm you do not have any pre existing tunnel on router which might be having same proxy IDs and is already negotiated with another peer. Lastly, please make sure the ESP, protocol 50 traffic is not blocked in the transit. Hope this helps. Regards, Dinesh Moudgil P.S.

Regards, Dinesh Moudgil P.S. Please rate helpful posts., I do ASA's with IPSEC site to site and AnyConnect for a living. Very specific job. But I do a lot of them. I made a script by taking a known working good configuration and identifying the variables. I then can make a configuration for a new ASA in my ""cookie cutter"" format very quickly. This includes AnyConnect. However you may or may not be doing a lot and just have one on your mind. You can export your configuration in the ASDM and move it to a new device. The setting for the new device would be the same as for the old device. You might have to do some basic stuff like generating new keys or working with certificates if needed. But it can be done. I prefer a cut and past in the command line. I move files after the device is configured. With the ASDM you can import and export a configuration. With command line I start with a write erase on the new device and then cut and paste only what is necessary. Under tools in the ASDM use ""backup"" and ""restore""., Thank you both for replying. The old one is asa5540 and new one is asa5555. I do not know if ASDM could be used for transferringbetween the two types of ASA Another issueis that there are a lot stuff in old one in old one, some of them are inactive. we hope to just pick up the active ones among them. Andwe have to pickup all of active components and wont miss any active components. If we use asdm, at least we maybe pick up all of them. Thank you so much for your suggestion!, I just migrated from an old series to the new series. I slowly reviewed the entire configuration. Did a good backup. I eliminated all those configuration parts that I knew I could delete. Old rules (both nat and firewall) were made inactive and not deleted. I then moved the configuration to the new device. It wasn't too bad. I wired up the new firewall with the uplink ports turned down. Maintenance night I turned the ports up for the new firewall and the ports down for the old one. Almost everything worked with the exception of a few NAT rules. I guess good planning goes a long way. You could try moving the whole thing to the new one. There aren't too many changes in the ASA code from the old device to the new one., Our old ASA is doing too much work. we would like new one share the work with old one. So, we want new one doing vpn work only. If we copy all configuration to the new one, it would be relatively easy for us to transfer. but this would make the configuration in new asabigger. so, based on the present information we have, we want to transfer anyconect vpn with asdm and l2l vpn manually. Now I dont know how to transfer username attribute, which may be associated with active directory in Windows server. Do you have any experience with it? or directly copy it?

In my case i have not configured any acl, i have configured interesting traffic acl that i have associated withcrytpo map and then i have configured twice nat for vpn trafic, please let me know in case if i have to configure anything as i told at the moment tunnel comes up if someone generates the traffic other side and my asa is not sending any traffic back on the tunnel., You would not need to configure any access-list entry on the inside interface for VPN traffic if there is none present. Try adding these commands:- no nat (inside,INN) source static VPN_LOCAL VPN_LOCAL destination static REMOTE_ACCESS REMOTE_ACCESS no-proxy-arp route-lookup nat (inside,INN) 1 source static VPN_LOCAL VPN_LOCAL destination static REMOTE_ACCESS REMOTE_ACCESS no-proxy-arp route-lookup And please share the packet tracer command that you are running.

Please rate helpful posts., thank you Dinesh, yes i have 10.0.0.0/8 routing pointing to inside network and default route pointing to outside interface. I have added route as default rout for my remote subnet. when i see packet trace everything is allow. tunnel is coming up. but i am not able to send any traffic over the tunnel from asa. the local interesting subnet is different that the inside interface subnet. Is it because of thati'm not able to ping my remote subnet IP?, If the local interesting traffic is different then inside interface subnet, then the pings will not work if you use ""ping inside x.x.x.x"". You can only run packet tracer or create actual traffic to see the encryption counters increasing. Regards, Dinesh Moudgil P.S. Please rate helpful posts., HI Dinesh,  Thank you so much for valuable inputs. however packet tracer is not increasing any encryption/decryption count. I will try to connect some devices and try generating traffic from the actual subnet and check phase2 status., Allow me to rephrase it, counters will only increment if you initiate actual traffic but packet tracer should be enough to bring phase 1 and phase 2 up. You can run show crypto isakmp sa for phase 1 and show crypto ipsec sa peer x.x.x.x for phase 2 and it should both of them up. Regards, Dinesh Moudgil P.S.

Typically used to accommodate a few tunnels with different profiles and characteristics (different partners, sites, location) So when you have the information of both the peers that what policies are we going to use, what is the IP on both the devices we normally use Static VPN.

The traffic can be initiated bidirectional, once the SA has been created, you can check this with the command ""show crypto ipsec sa peer x.x.x.x""  This will depend as well of your ACL configuration, for example if we have the following ACL for the crypto config. 192.168.10.0/24---remote------ISP----HQ------192.168.20.0/24 access-list vpn permit ip 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 If a ping is triggered from the remote site, it will bring up the SA for the whole network, after that any host on the 10.0 will be able to communicate with 20.0 and viceversa.

Let me know, how this coming alone.  thanks Rizwan Rafeek., Hi Rizwan,  I enabled the tunnel group with the statement you provided. tunnel-group cnd-vpn webvpn-attributes group-url https://96.92.178.237/cnd-vpn enable I still cannot establish a vpn connection anymore. Thanks for getting back to me... I can't figure this out.  Chris, Rizwan,  In the ASSDM syslog, I see what I think is the VPN request coming in. It states the following.  TCP acces denied by ACL from 70.215.1.124/11275 to outside:96.92.178.237/80  Chris, Remove this line: nat (any,outside) source static any any destination static og-cndvpn-pool og-cndvpn-pool no-proxy-arp route-lookup  copy this instead. nat (inside,outside) 1 source static any any destination static og-cndvpn-pool og-cndvpn-pool no-proxy-arp route-lookup, Rizwan,  Still no change... I cannot establish a VPN session or ping the outside interface from outside of the network. In the ASSDM syslog, I see what I think is the VPN request coming in, and the ICMP packets from my outside pings being dropped also. It states the following.  TCP acces denied by ACL from 70.215.1.124/11275 to outside:96.92.178.237/80  Chris, Outside interface is not pingable has nothing to do with you cannot vpn in. ""route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.10.1 1""  Shouldn't your default route be pointing to your ISP's next-hop address instead?, I understand there is no relation between the vpn issue and not being able to ping the outside interface. I should have differentiated the two issues. I appologize...  ""route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.10.1 1"" My lab sits behind a commercial ISP gateway (modem). The gateway is also a DHCP server and provides NAT to its internal network (10.1.10.0/24). MyASAconnects toa switchport on the gateway device and has static public IP. The gateway also has a static public IP... should I change the default route to the gateway's public IP? I still don't see how that is related to the syslog message showing my VPN request being denied due to an ACL.  I appologize for the confusion and any frustration I may cause. I am a novice and appreciate your time greatly!  Thanks  Chris, If you are remote-in to your ASA's public address and then the return traffic for vpn-usersâ public address must ergress out in the same direction through which traffic came in, otherwise you will create asymmetric route.  Yes, please point your default route to ASA's next-hop address which is your ISP-device's IPand try it. thanks, Have you put back the default-route to ASA's next-hop address which is your ISP-device's IPand try it?, Good morning Rizwan,  I just made the default route point to the outside interface of the ISP gateway (96.92.178.238). Still unable to establish a VPN connection.  Rizwan... you are incredibly helpful, and I appreciate that. Current configuration attached.   Chris Attachment: asa_config_17jul_0800.txt, can you please post a diagram of your toplogy., I added the webvpn | svc enable statement. Still no change. Diagram attached.  Thanks Chris Attachment: cnd_lab.pptx, Can you confirm this is correct, your diagram shows your public IP on ASA as /30 whereas you have assinged on ""outside"" interface as /29?, This was a mistake on the diagram. The outside network is a /29  Correct diagram is attached. Attachment: cnd_lab.pptx, Are you able to ping a public IP, such as 4.2.2.2 from the ASA?, Yes I can ping 4.2.2.2, just for temp you may want to allow icmp any any on your ouside acl.  access-list outside_access_in line 1 extended permit icmp any any  I can ping your default-gate address but not your ASA's outside address.  Can you post output from ""showinterface GigabitEthernet0/1"", Please copy this line on ""config mode"" and try it.  webvpn svc enable  thanks]",[16],1,2015-07-15,12558456,1,22,"Hello Cisco Support Community,  I have a lab that consists of a two virtual environments connected to a 3750-G switch which is connected to a 2901 router which is connected to an ASA 5512-X which is connected to my ISP gateway.

It currently is offered in two versions- Plus and Apex. Plus is a basic remote access VPN and requires the client be installed on the end user computer. Apex is the high end version with many more advanced features and can optionally be used to setup clientless SSL VPN whereby the end user needs only a browser. See the AnyConnect product information pages for many more details., Marvin thanks alot for your support., You're welcome.

That wouldforce the use of the Essentials license even though you have an available Premium license. Generally speaking, aLAN-LANIPsec VPN should negotiate to the first group the peershave in common in their respective configurations. ARemote access IPsec VPN should negotiate to the level specified by the server (the ASA)., Sir, I do indeed have ""anyconnect-essentials"" under ""webvpn"". Should I negate this line? I see that it says: anyconnect-essentials  Enable/Disable AnyConnect Essentials  If I ""no anyconnect-essentials"", will that force the ASA to revert to my Premium license? Or will I lose the ability to use AnyConnect clients? Thank you, When you have licenses for both AnyConnect Essentials and Premium on as ASA you need to choose one or the other type for all AnyConnect clients. We typically see this where a customer started out with the Essentials license and then later added Premium. When you do that, you need to configure ""no anyconnect-essentials"" in order to use the features that require the Premium license level. All the Essentials clients should continue to work in your case since the number of licensed users is equal on both license types. On the larger appliances, the Premium licenses may be less than the number of Essentials licenses since the former is sold by number of users (and can get quite costly on the larger devices since they can potentially support 1000s of users) and the latter is one relatively low costlicense that covers the entire device according to its hardware capability. Onthe 5505 the maximum capacity is 25 and you have that same number already licensed for Premium. (The available Premium license SKUsfor that platform are 10 and 25.), Sir, Your expertise in the world of ASA is uncanny. You were spot on. I removed the ""anyconnect-essentials"" and changed my ikev2 back to ""group 21"" and now both my L2L and my AnyConnect are properly negotiating at Group 21: Encr: AES-CBC, keysize: 256, Hash: SHA512, DH Grp:21, Auth sign: RSA, Auth verify: EAP Thank you again!, Thanks for the feedback- I appreciate it. Many engineers, even quite competent ones, don't deal with their firewalls day to day and often find the vast array of features and how they've changed over the years daunting.

Thanks, Hello Ahmed,  Check for the route (i.e. remote subnet route) is point in the right direction, that is route is pushed toward the ASA's gateway address and from you internal switches the route is pushed toward the ASA inside address.  if that didn't resolve the problem, post your whole config and tell me what is the tunnel in question that you are having issue with.

As long as below two red-highlighted IP-addreses do not change, you can use same acl (NET1) to change remote destination address.

283,283,davidwatson1,"[user1, asker, user1, asker, user1, asker, user1, asker, user1]","[David  The answer to your question depends a little on how you plan to implement the IPSec between routers. If you use the traditional IPSec with crypto map approach then the second access list that you mention to permit only RDP is applied in the crypto map and not to the interface. If you use something like VTI to encrypt traffic between the routers the approach would be a bit different since VTI removes the need to configure crypto maps. With VTI you would need to restrict traffic going through the tunnel to only RDP.  HTH  Rick, Hi Richard OK great thanks, yes im looking to setup using crypto so i will apply to this.

I will disable periodic DPD and see if that solves things. What more information can I give you?  Thanks!, Try IKEv2?:-) You know it's good for you!  Check whether you may or may not have multiple IKE sessions. And remember even changing DPDs configuration will not take immediate effect- you need to still re-key IKE sessions. In case you were thinking it's just as easy as changing DPD config., Hehe, will sure do!:) Though we have around 200 spokes that needs to be reconfigured. It would be more satisfactory to solve the current issues without ikev2:) As a matter of fact there are multiple IKE sessions to this particular spoke and other as well. 64 as of this writing. Is this normal? On the hub: #show crypto ipsec sa peer &lt;spoke nbma> | count current_peer Number of lines which match regexp = 64 # Also the IKE seems to be associated with the wrong tunnel interface., Those are IPsec SA count, probably a bit too much, but most likely not all of those are active- a couple could have been introduced because of the problem we see in debugs (PROPOSAL_NOT_CHOSEN). Hard to say without actually seeing what they are... but indeed it's uncommon for a spoke to have so many IPsec SAs (in DMVPN). You'd need have a look at ""show cry isa sa"" output to check what IKE sessions exist., By looking at the ""Status:"" on the IPSEC SA's with this spokethe 64 are all active. Both inbound and outbound. They say: Status: ACTIVE(ACTIVE) By looking at show crypto ipsec sa peer &lt;spoke nbma> It seems it creates one IPSECsaper tunnel interface on the hub (almost), when looking at the output of ""Interface:""? Even though this particular spoke should be associated with just one tunnel interface (Tunnel2010).Is this normal when sharing the ipsec profile, perhaps? #show crypto ipsec sa peer &lt;spoke nbma> | inc interface: interface: Tunnel3300 interface: Tunnel3260 interface: Tunnel3160 interface: Tunnel2931 interface: Tunnel2930 interface: Tunnel2818 interface: Tunnel2817 interface: Tunnel2816 interface: Tunnel2815 interface: Tunnel2814 interface: Tunnel2813 interface: Tunnel2812 interface: Tunnel2811 interface: Tunnel2750 interface: Tunnel2661 interface: Tunnel2660 interface: Tunnel2590 interface: Tunnel2470 interface: Tunnel2342 interface: Tunnel2341 interface: Tunnel2340 interface: Tunnel2220 interface: Tunnel2190 interface: Tunnel2180 interface: Tunnel2160 interface: Tunnel2011 interface: Tunnel2010 interface: Tunnel1933 interface: Tunnel1932 interface: Tunnel1931 interface: Tunnel1930 interface: Tunnel1820 interface: Tunnel1720 interface: Tunnel1700 interface: Tunnel1680 interface: Tunnel1670 interface: Tunnel1450 interface: Tunnel1370 interface: Tunnel1360 interface: Tunnel1050 interface: Tunnel871 interface: Tunnel870 interface: Tunnel850 interface: Tunnel710 interface: Tunnel550 interface: Tunnel545 interface: Tunnel542 interface: Tunnel540 interface: Tunnel490 interface: Tunnel480 interface: Tunnel470 interface: Tunnel469 interface: Tunnel468 interface: Tunnel461 interface: Tunnel460 interface: Tunnel430 interface: Tunnel410 interface: Tunnel380 interface: Tunnel360 interface: Tunnel310 interface: Tunnel292 interface: Tunnel250 interface: Tunnel2591  When looking at ""show crypto isakmp sa"" I saw a couple of duplicated entries to this spoke. This was fixed by clearing the crypto session. I've not seen it since then., Ha, indeed I only saw one tunnel in the config you've outlined. There are a couple of interested (cosmetic and not) side effects when using ""shared""... that's why I prefer FlexVPN for those scenarios. I think some enhancements came to ""shared"" code relatively recently (1.5 years ago...)  Regardless... any changes in behavior since moving to non-periodic DPDs?, Yeah, sorry for leaving that ""little"" part out:) I see. FlexVPN looks interesting. From what i've read it is difficult to implement this on an already DMVPN enabled device?  Yes actually, from what I can see the spokes have been more stable since moving to non-periodic DPD's andrenegotiatingthe tunnels. I will still keep an eye on this though. Do you see anything else that I can improve or adjust regarding the configuration? Thank you very much this far, Marcin., Well hard to say, I think you've for a pretty cool thing going. BGP as routing protocol already a big plus. VRF separation for ISPs and inside, I wish more people had that. Periodic DPDs are also a pretty good idea (overall).  How many spokesare you terminating per ASR? (I assume you have two)  Maybe one suggestion is to use certificates instead of PSK... there's a slight learning curve, but IOS devices can act as both DMVPN nodes and CAs... I think there was/is a limitation that ASRs could/can not act as CAs. Another... your encryption suite is fine, but I'd probably look into updating it, should spokes support it... AES-GCM is pretty sweet. Vide: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/nextgen_crypto.html#2  A couple of years back I wrote DM to Flex migration guide: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/flexvpn/116678-config... Obviously it's for a very simple example. But what's good with newer software is that you can have co-existence of FlexVPN and DMVPN on same boxes (you'd need something newer than IOS XE 10.3 and IOS 15... I want to say 15.3T). You can move between FlexVPN and DMVPN tunnels using BGP. Oh I wish we had unlimited time in the lab to play with things;], Cool. Um, by runningsh dmvpn and counting NBMA Peers there arearound 200+ spokes perASR.  Really cool, I will definitely look into this. Yeah, I agree with you. If you only had more time..:) What do you think of implementing if-state nhrp on the spokes? Would this help me inthis scenario? Lastly, what would you prefer to accomplish DMVPN-redundancy on the spoke, two tunnel interfaces to each hub with different tunnel subnetsor just one tunnel interface with configuration for both hubs using same tunnel subnet? Thanks,, 200-300 per ASR seems decent, lots of possibilityto scale up on most ASR1ks. if-state nhrp... it's good for monitoring, and if you're running only spoke to hub traffic. If you do have some spoke to spoke you'll start losing the benefits (especially in case of failure). For redundancy on spokes I'm definitely a proponent of multi-cloud. But I do like things compartmentalized. It's easier to manage and make changes on- you know that changing X on tunnel Y will not impact tunnel Z--- or at least should not:} It does take a bit more implementation effortbut I find that it's easier to understand. Hey, a thought, even if you FlexVPN is not for you at the moment, don't write off IKEv2... DMVPN integrates with IKEv2! If you're thinking about implementing redundancy on spokes... have on tunnel interface using IKEv1 another using IKEv2- at least it out.:-), All right, thanks for yourinput! Regarding IKEv2 I will check this out! Thanks for all the help and input. Greatly appreciate it.:)]",[0],1,2015-06-25,12542761,0,12,"Hello world,  After migrating our dual DMVPN hub solutionfrom ISR2 3925 to ASR-1001X (running asr1001x-universalk9.03.12.03.S.154-2.S3-std.SPA.bin)  we startedhaving some issues with spokes tunnels flapping (going up and down) and sometimenever comeup. Running 'show dmvpn' the spoke is stuck in NHRP state toward our hub. To resolve the issue we run 'shutdown' and then 'no shutdown' on the tunnel interface of the spoke the DMVPN goes up. Also running 'clear crypto session &lt;remote hub nbma>' on the spoke often solves the problem. So it seems the issue has something to do with IPSEC.

But why is it going up after either clearing the crypto session or shutting down the tunnel interface and activate the tunnel interface of the spoke? Very weird. Also, by looking att the debug-messages of the hubit seems the crypto is associated with the wrong tunnel interface Tu3300 when it should be Tu2010. Normal or Bug?

Running 'show dmvpn' the spoke is stuck in NHRP state toward our hub. To resolve the issue we run 'shutdown' and then 'no shutdown' on the tunnel interface of the spoke the DMVPN goes up. Also running 'clear crypto session &lt;remote hub nbma>' on the spoke often solves the problem. So it seems the issue has something to do with IPSEC.

But why is it going up after either clearing the crypto session or shutting down the tunnel interface and activate the tunnel interface of the spoke? Very weird. Also, by looking att the debug-messages of the hubit seems the crypto is associated with the wrong tunnel interface Tu3300 when it should be Tu2010. Normal or Bug?

286,286,ramesh.8901,"[user1, asker, user2, asker]","[Ramesh  I would expect that the source address would be the inside interface of the Internet ASA.  HTH  Rick, Hi Richard,  Thanks for the response. I thought as much too; however i couldn't find any documentation to confirm this. Would you happen to know if this is documented somewhere?  Thanks!, Hi Ramesh, Referencing this document, it states- ""In a WebVPN connection, the security appliance acts as a proxy between the end user web browser and target web servers."" This implies that ASA will proxy the WebVPN user request to the destination. This proxy request will depend on the accessibility of the destination server. If the resources are accessible via inside interface, then the source will be inside interface and similarly DMZ interface if the resources are accessible via DMZ. I have tested this but for your confirmation, you can run a wireshark capture on LAN interfaces and you can see the HTTP requests being proxied by ASA's LAN interfaces. Regards, Dinesh Moudgil P.S.

Me, im on IOS 8.4(2), so it should be the same thing. If you want to push a route for you inside network to your client for example: access-list SPLIT-TUNNEL standard permit ip 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 Then in your group-policy group-policy GroupPolicy_abeone_VPN internal group-policy GroupPolicy_abeone_VPN attributes split-tunnel-policy tunnelspecified- if you want to split the traffic split-tunnel-policy value SPLIT-TUNNEL, The suggestion about configuring for split tunneling is interesting. But since the reported problem is no ability to access the inside network I do not see how split tunneling is going to fix it.  I am glad to see the identify NAT configured for traffic from inside to the VPN pool and that does address one potential problem.  I do notice in the configuration the specification of the group policy default-group-policy GroupPolicy_AJDSYINGAA_VPN but I do not seeGroupPolicy_AJDSYINGAA_VPN configured anywhere.  I also wonder if the network inside has a route to the VPN address pool.  HTH  Rick, Normally the inside network of the ASA does not need a route back to the address pool of the anyconnect VPN. I've just setup it and i never needed routes. Im agree that i do not see whereGroupPolicy_AJDSYINGAA_VPN is confirgured. But at the same time, you cannot setup a default-group-policy statement for a group policy that does not exist if im not wrong. Another thing, if your servers are windows server 2012, their firewall block incoming icmp. So you have to disable this rule on the windows server.  To troubleshoot your ping issue, you can also issue the command management-access inside. It will allow you to ping the ASA's default-gateway through the anyconnect VPN. If the ping is successful on the gateway, your have more chance your issue is coming from you servers or maybe some network devices between the server and the ASA., I reset the config and config it again and now there is just one group policy available. i tried management-access inside and able to ping from anyclient to gateway. from firewall i can ping to the server. and windows 7 machine. i tried the split-tunnel too. one of the command gives me the following error split-tunnel-policy value SPLIT-TUNNEL           ^ ERROR: % Invalid input detected at '^' marker.  i have the same result. i can see inside network   ASA Version 9.1(2)! hostname ciscoasa enable password 8Ry2YjIyt7RRXU24 encrypted names ip local pool VPN_Pool 192.168.78.1-192.168.78.254 mask 255.255.255.0! interface GigabitEthernet0/0 nameif inside security-level 100 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0! interface GigabitEthernet0/1 nameif outside security-level 0 ip address 13.15.13.60 255.0.0.0! ftp mode passive same-security-traffic permit inter-interface same-security-traffic permit intra-interface object network OBJ_VPNPOOL subnet 192.168.78.0 255.255.255.0 object network OBJ-Inside subnet 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 object network NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.78.0_24 subnet 192.168.78.0 255.255.255.0 object network network_obj_192.168.78.0_24 object network obj-inside object-group network &lt;OBJ-Inside> network-object 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 pager lines 24 logging asdm informational mtu management 1500 mtu inside 1500 mtu outside 1500 icmp unreachable rate-limit 1 burst-size 1 no asdm history enable arp timeout 14400 no arp permit-nonconnected nat (inside,outside) source static any any destination static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.78.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.78.0_24 no-proxy-arp route-lookup! nat (inside,outside) after-auto source dynamic &lt;OBJ-Inside> interface route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 13.15.13.1 1 timeout xlate 3:00:00 timeout pat-xlate 0:00:30 timeout conn 1:00:00 half-closed 0:10:00 udp 0:02:00 icmp 0:00:02 timeout sunrpc 0:10:00 h323 0:05:00 h225 1:00:00 mgcp 0:05:00 mgcp-pat 0:05:00 timeout sip 0:30:00 sip_media 0:02:00 sip-invite 0:03:00 sip-disconnect 0:02:00 timeout sip-provisional-media 0:02:00 uauth 0:05:00 absolute timeout tcp-proxy-reassembly 0:01:00 timeout floating-conn 0:00:00 dynamic-access-policy-record DfltAccessPolicy user-identity default-domain LOCAL http server enable http 192.168.5.0 255.255.255.0 management no snmp-server location no snmp-server contact snmp-server enable traps snmp authentication linkup linkdown coldstart warmstart! telnet timeout 5 ssh timeout 5 ssh key-exchange group dh-group1-sha1 console timeout 0 webvpn enable outside anyconnect-essentials anyconnect image disk0:/anyconnect-win-2.5.2014-k9.pkg 1 anyconnect enable tunnel-group-list enable group-policy GroupPolicy_abeone_VPN internal group-policy GroupPolicy_abeone_VPN attributes wins-server none dns-server value 192.168.10.9 vpn-tunnel-protocol ssl-client default-domain value NWD.Net group-policy GroupPolicy_abeone_VPN internal group-policy GroupPolicy_abeone_VPN attributes split-tunnel-policy tunnelspecified username mt password /oETeAnGnysKS53o encrypted tunnel-group abeone_VPN type remote-access tunnel-group abeone_VPN general-attributes address-pool VPN_Pool default-group-policy GroupPolicy_abeone_VPN tunnel-group abeone_VPN webvpn-attributes group-alias abeone_VPN enable! class-map inspection_default match default-inspection-traffic!! policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map parameters  message-length maximum client auto  message-length maximum 512 policy-map global_policy class inspection_default  inspect dns preset_dns_map  inspect ftp  inspect h323 h225  inspect h323 ras  inspect rsh  inspect rtsp  inspect esmtp  inspect sqlnet  inspect skinny   inspect sunrpc  inspect xdmcp  inspect sip   inspect netbios  inspect tftp  inspect ip-options! service-policy global_policy global prompt hostname context, my mistake. its splitâtunnel-policy tunnelspecified split-tunnel-network-list value SPLIT-TUNNEL or splitâtunnel-policy tunnelall if you want that all client traffic including traffic going to internet pass through your corporate firewall. To resume. After you issue the command management-access inside, you are able to:- ping the firewall inside GW from any anyconnect client but you cant still ping other LAN devices that are on the same subnet?- but you can ping LAN devices from your firewall  right?, after i used the command management-access inside, i was able to ping from anyconnect client to Gateway but not other devices. From firewall i can ping all other devices., I see a problem in the config where there is group-policy GroupPolicy_abeone_VPN attributes split-tunnel-policy tunnelspecified but there is not anything that specifies what networks are tunneled. The policy needs to point at an access list that identifies the networks or it needs specify all tunnels.  I am not sure if this is the only issue. But fix this one and tell us if the behavior changes.  HTH  Rick, That is weird, because even without a split tunnel you should be able to ping your LAN like Richard said.

But in your config, you start your anyconnect pool from.1 to.254 ASA Version 9.1(2)! hostname ciscoasa enable password 8Ry2YjIyt7RRXU24 encrypted names ip local pool VPN_Pool 192.168.78.1-192.168.78.254 mask 255.255.255.0  Try to start the pool from 192.168.78.2 and see if it works. I think it's a duplicate ip address. Your first VPN client is taking the anyconnect gateway as its ip address and it might be a problem. So when you are trying to ping a device on a different subnet (192.168.10.0 in this scenario), your packet as too reach your anyconnect gateway (that your VPN client takes) to reach a remote subnet., The suggestion about changing the VPN pool to not use 192.168.78.1 may be worth trying. But I will be very surprised if it solves the problem. I have seen VPN sessions that do not show the default gateway but still access things without any problem. The VPN client treats the VPN session more like a point to point session where it just forwards all the encrypted traffic to the peer (which it does know). The VPN client really does not need a default gateway.  I believe that the problem may be in this line in the config default-group-policy GroupPolicy_Abilityone_VPN That policy is not defined in the config. You need this line to point to something that is defined with a viable policy for the VPN client.  I am also confused (and perhaps a bit concerned) about this entry in the config object network network_obj_192.168.78.0_24 object network obj-inside  This entry is an unfortunate mixture of parameters for inside and for outside.  HTH  Rick, I am very thankful to both of you. i really appreciate your help and any further suggestioniswelcome because i am still not able to access.

So I am wondering about the possibility of it being some issue with the devices inside. Can you post the output of show arp on the ASA?Can devices on the inside access the Internet using the ASA?

If it is windows server, especially 2012, you have a lot of chance that their firewall block incoming icmp. Try disable their firewall to see if there is a change. And for me too, the ASA configuration seems valid., I believe that the original poster has told us that from the firewall he is able to ping those addresses. Is that correct?  That would seem to indicate that it is not an issue with firewall on the servers preventing ping. But it does suggest that there is an issue with ping from a remote address that is not a problem with ping from a local address. Perhaps there is some security policy on the servers beyond simple permit or deny of ping.  Would it be possible to post the output of ipconf and route print from the servers?  HTH  Rick, Please see attachment for IPConfig /all Attachment: untitled_picture.png, Perhaps you did not understand our request. What we asked for was the ipconfig (and the route print) from one or both of the servers that you are trying to ping. What you gave us is the ipconfig from your PC with an AnyConnect connection.  HTH  Rick, Please see attached file for route print and IPconfig. i hope this time is the correct one Attachment: route_print.png, This time it is the server. And the output do show that the default gateway and default route do point to the ASA. So this is not the explanation for the problem with access from AnyConnect.  The config posted is incomplete. Is there any access-group used to apply an access list to any interface?  Do you have logging enabled on the ASA? And if so when you attempt to ping from AnyConnect to the server are there any log entries generated that mention either of the addresses?  HTH  Rick, If he does a packet-tracer on the ASA from the vpn pool to an inside address, would this be revelant? Or maybe a capture packet?, Both of these are interesting suggestions. A packet tracer might be where I would start and hope that it could verify that the issue was not something in the processing of the ASA. And a packet capture might clarify whether the ping was being sent out the inside interface and whether any kind of response was being received.  HTH  Rick, when i ping and check log it gives me this error 6 Jul 06 2015 18:59:44 302021 192.168.78.11 1 192.168.10.9 0 Teardown ICMP connection for faddr 192.168.78.11/1(LOCAL\macboy276) gaddr 192.168.10.9/0 laddr 192.168.10.9/0 (macboy276), Please see attachment for packet tracer Attachment: packet_tracer.jpg, The packet tracer that you posted shows inside as both source and destination. I believe that the traffic that we are interested in would have source as outside and destination as inside. Also the packet tracer has http as both the source and destination port. The source port should be some random high number port.  HTH  Rick, Try add to your policy-map an inspect icmp. policy-map global_policy class inspection_default  inspect icmp  Note:my messages are beeing placed between old messages i dont know why, The log message given does verify that the ASA is sending the ping request and that is good to have.  The suggestion about adding inspect icmp is a very good suggestion. I am optimistic that this might solve the problem.  HTH  Rick, I guess you've add the inspect icmp to the global policy and it works now?, Thanks Kev and Rick. you both were very supportive and helpful. i appreciate effort.

I've attached both and they are entire (except passwords). The parts I'm keen to get sanity-checked are the crypto stuff and also my access lists (acl-EXT-IN). For example, I have a DHCP server at both sites, but now that I'm no longer permitting all traffic, is it necessary for me to still be blocking DHCP? Many thanks again for your time and help. Jim Attachment: sd_site_final.txt slf_site_final.txt, Hi nice to hear that. Why blocking dhcp? It's for internal lan? If there isn't the same subnet on each part it's not needed but for security reason, youbcan continue blocking it. thanks PS: Please don't forget to rate and mark as correct answer if this solved your issue, Just my understanding- or lack thereof- of DHCP:-) I assumed that a device didn't know which subnet it was on, and sent the DHCP request out (broadcast), and I was worried that the DHCP server at the ""other site"" might reply. Am I mistaken? Jim, The broadcast remains on the vlan except if you configured the ip dhcp-helper. However if subnets are different and also if you don't redirect dhcp broadcast on the other end, no chance to get flooded by dhcp request on the other end andno chance to get a reply. But again as I said, for security, it's better to control which traffic can pass through the tunnel and which one not. I will leave as it is to protect. Thanks PS: Please don't forget to rate and mark as correct answer if this solved your issue, Same vlan but different subnets, and no DHCP broadcast. So I should be safe. Many thanks for your help, I couldn't have achieved it without your guidance. VERY much appreciated.

However as soon as I add the command: int Tunnel0  tunnel protection ipsec profile protect-gre or int Tunnel0  tunnel mode ipsec ipv4 I can no longer ping.

Have you got NAT rules in place to example all traffic to the VPN range?, I tried this today. Using putty it cannot ping to the sites across the WAN, but can ping in this office. I then did a traceroute, and it is immediately going to the 0.0.0.0 route which the the internet providers router. The traceroute goes to the internal gateway as it should for both 172.17.x.x 255.255.0.0 and 192.168.10.x 255.255.255.0 so I added a static route to192.168.20.x 255.255.255.0 and I can now trace route and ping from the ASA. I then went back to my vpn client and still no response. I think your idea set me on the right path, but I think it is still one step away from done. What NAT rule are you suggesting in the second part of your answer?  Thanks so much for your help, I can almost see this thing working., Do your remote sites and WAN have a default route pointing back to the ASA? If not, do they have a route for the AnyConnect VPN pool range? Probably need to see your config to help much more., It turned out that your suggestion was correct, but the problem was outside my control. In case someone else is in a similar situation, this is the problem. In some cases the MPLS provider has to allow packets destined for a different WAN site to flow through them based on allowed IPs. They don't have a route mapped from what I can tell, but rather they have allowable IP ranges listed. Based on your suggestion I remembered years ago I had to let them know when I added a special subnet for a particular project we had going on. I sent the VPN range to my provider and between your suggestion of the static route and the provider allowing the number range, it works!

294,294,showipinterface,"[user1, asker, user1, asker, user1, asker, user1, asker]","[For a remote access VPN, those parameters are controlled by the headend (ASA or IOS router). There are some client-specific parameters that are pushed down from the headend as well in the form of xml files. These too are generally stored on (and updated from) the headend. The client software image is a package file (pkg) that is typically downloaded from the headend device (although it can optionally be deployed via any enterprise software deployment tool). One can find the pkg, iso and such deployment files at the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client product downloads page., Thank you so much for your reply. So the image should contain some commands which are used in general VPN, such as ""crypto isakmp policy"" ""crypto ipsec--"", right?, You're welcome. No- the image does not contain any commands per se. It is a set of installer files for its target OS (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux). Most remote access VPNs are SSL-based, so the isakmp and ispec commands are not applicable there. For IPsec (IKEv2-based is the only IPsec VPN supported with AnyConnect clients), the crypto parameters are wholly resident on the headend device in its running configuration. Those parameters are not controllable whatsoever at the client end- the headend tells it what to do and how to do it according to its configuration., But I cannot see any these kinds of command in headend device configuration. Where are these commands? The below is Anyconnect VPN configuration  http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa80/configuration/gu... https://www.fir3net.com/Firewalls/Cisco/asa-anyconnect-basic-setup.html, Those two examples are both SSL VPN (also known variously as ""webvpn"" and ""svc"" or SSL VPN client). As I noted earlier,the commands you asked about are IPsec-related. AnyConnect support for IKEv2 IPsec was introduced in ASA 8.4 software, working in conjunction with AnyConnect 3.0 or later. So, if you look at a configuration guide for that sort of setup, you will see the IPsec-specific commands (among others). For example: https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/74111/asa-anyconnect-ikev2-conf..., Thank you so much for your explanation. Now I am still a little confused. Can I say we already talked two kind of SSL?Firstis what I mentioned: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa80/configuration/gu... https://www.fir3net.com/Firewalls/Cisco/asa-anyconnect-basic-setup.html Second is what you mentioned: IPSec-related SSL. My question is the first kind of SSLdo not need configuration commands of ""crypto isakmp policy"" ""crypto ipsec--""? Usually the first one is popular, right?, IPsec is not a kind of SSL. It is a different cryptographic mechanism altogether. IPsec uses pre-shared keys (almost always) and is thus symmetric cryptography (both peers have the same ""secret""). Up until about 4-5 ears ago it was the predominant VPN technology and is still very widely used, especially in site-site VPNs. SSL uses a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with a private key (""secret"") not shared between peers and thus is asymmetric. Most new remote access VPNs in the past several years are SSL-based. SSL does not use the crypto isakmp or cryptoipsec configuration lines but instead relies on certificates and trustpoints. Complicating the landscape is that there is a new more secure IPsec VPN type based on IKEv2. This is not widely adopted in my experience but is increasingly used by some organizations and agencies needing to comply with more strict government standards., Thank you Marvin, Excellent explanation!]",[6],1,2015-06-19,12537996,0,8,"Hi I am new with Anyconnect VPN.

296,296,haris.hilmi,"[user1, user2, user3, user2]","[Hi Haris,  The behavior is correct. If R1 initiates the connection, it will send the first isakmp policy i.e. AES/SHA/Grp-2/Pre-share/Lifetime and once this will reach R3, R3 will scan policies configured for it and will scan from 10 to 50. It will get a match on 40. So AES with SHA is selected.  When R3 becomes initiator, 3DES/SHA/Grp2/Pre-share/Lifetime will be the first one in the match list (as it is first in the list with policy 10; policy 1 is incomplete). When the same will be scanned on R1 for match, it will get match on policy 20.  Now, you want AES/SHA/Group2/Pre-share to be selected everytime, then on R3, create a policy with lowest number.  For ex. crypto isakmp policy 1 encr aes 256 authentication pre-share group 2 lifetime 1800 hash sha When you apply this command, it will remove existing isakmp policy 1 however it will make no difference because isakmp policy 1 is incomplete.Please try this and let me know if this fixes your problem.  Thanks, Vishnu, Thanks Vishnu. What I still does not understand is, why when R1 initiates the connection, it chooses Policy 40 with lifetime=1800, instead of going down to Policy 50, where it has default lifetime of 86400. Shouldn't lifetime be matched as well?  That's a very good suggestion to prioritize the policy further by increasing policy number, but if R3 is a hub router with many other spokes IPSec peers, I worry that some other connections will be affected. Thanks., hi, R1 and R3 IKE phase 1 policy matched on policy 10 and 40 respectively. just like an ACL, it runs sequentially and stops on the first match. the IPsec VPN will always go for the lowest negotiated lifetime which is 1800 seconds vs the default 86400 sec (1 day). see helpful link: http://ccnpsecuritywannabe.blogspot.com/2014/08/ikev1-ipsec-site-to-site..., Hi John,  This is new to me. I tested the connection with different lifetimes configured and yes, the lower negotiated lifetime was chosen.

True your pool only assigns addresses from the lower half ofthe /24, but still.... I try to simplify things by using a single object for something like that which is used in multiple places.

access all internal IPs while connected through VPN to ASA5505 Hello,  I was able to setup VPN to work somewhat on my ASA 5505. I can connect to the VPN and ping some IPs inside the network. But some IPs are not responding, I get ""Request Timed Out""  For example: 10.10.0.4- it works 10.10.0.5- doesn't word 10.10.0.10- it works 10.10.0.11- it works 10.10.0.13- doesn'twork If I ping from the internal network everything works fine. Does anybody have any recommendations on how to approach this? Is the VPN marking the packets in a way that would trigger a firewall block?  This ismy ASA configuration:  The VPN with name ""Remote-VPN"" is the one that I'm using.

That's why the ASA is presenting the self-signed Cert ""Self-signed (EC 256 bits ecdsa-with-SHA256)"". So To avoid this, we need to remove the corresponding cipher suites using the ssl cipher command. we can execute the following command so that only RSA based ciphers are negotiated (ssl cipher tlsv1.2 custom ""AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA:DES-CBC-SHA:RC4-SHA:RC4-MD5"" HTH Abaji., Confirmed.

Re URLs, your can disable the aliases that populate the dropdown list on the web portal but as long as your have the SSL VPN service active, the ASA's outside interface will serve up the login page for at least the default connection profile. What's your rationale for wanting to disable it in the first place? Perhaps there's an alternate method to achieve what you want., Thanks for your quick response! Our customer asked us to disable the download / make not accessible the url of anyconect for download, so their end users only can use the pre-installed version anyconnect- which is provided by them. Dave., Well it definitely cannot be disabled on the ASA per se while leaving a functioning remote access SSL VPN. Thinking more on my earlier idea- you could put only an older 32-bit Linux Anyconnect image on the ASA. That way no Windows or OS X images of any kind would be available for download yet youcould still have a functioning SSL VPN.

314,314,ramesh.8901,"[user1, asker, user1, asker]","[Connection profile is what we know in the CLI as tunnel-group and the group-policy are settings that you can attach per connection profile/tunnel group. There are scenarios were you can select a connection profile/tunnel group but you get mapped to different group policy. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa70/configuration/guide/config/vpngrp.html The following link has a good example of this scenario. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/98634-asa-ldap-group-pol.html  Now, in the DAP policies if you specify a cisco attribute for connection profile or/and group policy., you are configuring a policy ONLY when the user matches this attributes. In other words, this DAP will take place when the user is using the connection profile and/or group policy that is configured.  http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa91/asdm71/vpn/asdm_71_vpn_config/vpn_asdm_dap.html#pgfId-1183627  I hope this helps., Hi, Thanks for that. However to me that seems to go against the priority list for vpns- dap, user policy, user-group policy, policy assigned to connection profile and then default policy. So the dap would in this case check to see if the user comes in a connection profile and then check to see whether the defined (mentioned in the selection criteria) user-group policy is assigned to him and then apply the corresponding dap policy for it? This seems like it's going down the list and then coming back up. Can you help me understand that?, Hello Remesh,  According to the configuration guide, this is the DAP connection sequence. DAP Connection Sequence The following sequence outlines a typical remote access connection establishment. 1. A remote client attempts a VPN connection. 2. The security appliance performs posture assessment, using configured NAC and Cisco Secure Desktop Host Scan values. 3. The security appliance authenticates the user via AAA. The AAA server also returns authorization attributes for the user. 4. The security appliance applies AAA authorization attributes to the session, and establishes the VPN tunnel. 5. The security appliance selects DAP records based on the user AAA authorization information and the session posture assessment information. 6. The security appliance aggregates DAP attributes from the selected DAP records, and they become the DAP policy. 7. The security appliance applies the DAP policy to the session. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asdm/6_2/user/guide/asdmconfig/vpn_dap.html#wp1138997  And this is the policy enforcement flow that you are referring to. The ASA applies attributes in the following order (see Figure C-1). 1. DAP attributes on the ASAâIntroduced in Version 8.0(2), these attributes take precedence over all others. If you set a bookmark or URL list in DAP, it overrides a bookmark or URL list set in the group policy. 2. User attributes on the AAA serverâThe server returns these attributes after successful user authentication and/or authorization. Do not confuse these with attributes that are set for individual users in the local AAA database on the ASA (User Accounts in ASDM). 3. Group policy configured on the ASAâIf a RADIUS server returns the value of the RADIUS CLASS attribute IETF-Class-25 (OU=group-policy) for the user, the ASA places the user in the group policy of the same name and enforces any attributes in the group policy that are not returned by the server. For LDAP servers, any attribute name can be used to set the group policy for the session. The LDAP attribute map that you configure on the ASA maps the LDAP attribute to the Cisco attribute IETF-Radius-Class. 4. Group policy assigned by the Connection Profile (called tunnel-group in the CLI)âThe Connection Profile has the preliminary settings for the connection, and includes a default group policy applied to the user before authentication. All users connecting to the ASA initially belong to this group, which provides any attributes that are missing from the DAP, user attributes returned by the server, or the group policy assigned to the user. 5. Default group policy assigned by the ASA (DfltGrpPolicy)âSystem default attributes provide any values that are missing from the DAP, user attributes, group policy, or connection profile. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa84/configuration/guide/asa_84_cli_config/ref_extserver.html#wp1773735  The way I understand this is that the user connects to the VPN and to do this they need a connection profile and a group-policy. This will trigger the DAP connection sequence. If there are special AAA attributes (such a dACL) or group-policy attributes (such a VPN-filter), DAP will overwrite them according to the policy enforcement flow.  I hope this help, Cheers Andres. That makes sense.

Also, is the DNS located on the inside, or outside? A little more detail on the topology please.., I did not understand because of what was the problem with access to the Internet.

Perhaps at the head office you can use both- but I'd but them side by side, not one behind the other., Thanks for the help. Here question arises, there will be some burden of call processing on cme router so why to use it if we have dedicated device for that purposes and all sites have ASA 5512X. So my question is 1. So if i use cme i have to buy security license and VPN ISM? if yes then my company will dont let me to make this because they already bought all the material. 2. There is no support hub spok in ASA at all? If yes then what if i place firewall on the edge? and make dmvpn or gre on cme and let firewall to do encryption for that purposes? Is that possible? 3. There also some clients who will remotely doing there work, so i will be doing ssl-client as well. So is it possible if i place my router on edge doing nat and firewall responding ssl. Whcih ports do i need to forward then..... So what you suggest. Waiting......., If you already have ASA's then put them on the outside. You'll have to built lots of site to site VPNS as there is no hub and spoke support like on the routers with DMVPN., I got it. Is there ant way to do Hub and spoke without buying anything on router excpt secuty license..., You can do MGRE (Multipoint GRE) without security., yup you right plain text packets..... Is there a way that i do mgre on router behind frewall and firewall do ipsec for interested traffic? waiting........., There would be but the complexity is way too high. You might as well stick with using your ASA's and just build lots of VPNs., Okay, thanks for helping me in clearing my points. Now what you suggest. 2951 cme and 5512 asa with firepower....

But that's not part of the problem. On both routers, you can enable ""debug ip icmp"" to see if the ping reaches the destination. then test the following pings: R1-L0 from the ASA R2-L0 from the ASA ASA inside from R1-L0 ASA outside from R2-L0, The solution issomething Itotally don't understand. On R1, I went ahead and pointed my default route to the next-hop as opposed to the outgoing interface.. and bam! the pings are working now. If you can explain, I will appreciate., After thinking about it twice, it's clear.I wrote to change it because it is a best practice, but with the ASA on the other side it's needed. If you use the outgoing interface as the destination of a route, the router needs to arp for the destination-IP (for each one that is used) to find the next-hop L2-address. The other side (the ASA in your scenario) needs to have proxy-arp enabled for that because the request is not for a configured address. If you configure an IP as the next hop, the router needs only to find the L2-address for the one next-hop IP-address that is used in the static route., Also, your suggestion about enabling ""ip debug icmp"" helped. That is when I noticed that the pings weren't even leaving R1. That is when I thought take another look at the routing and with your other suggestion in mind....Plus I have learnt something new, the one about ASA's and proxy-arp. once again cheers!!]",[5],1,2015-05-25,12515836,0,7,"I am setting up asa in my GNS3 lab, however I am unable to ping across the firewall, from inside interface to outside interface.

328,328,sean6605,"[user1, asker, user1, asker]","[You are probably running into more then one problem here (I assume that you are using an old way to configure EzVPN): For using the NAT the way you configured it, the gig0/0 needs to be """"ip nat inside"" and ""ip nat outside"" at the same time which is not possible. If you solve the NAT, you need to include ""any"" into your encryption domain as the hub-router needs to encrypt traffic from any internet-source to the branch-camera. This is done automatically if you don't use split-tunneling. For the hub, you should migrate EzVPN to use virtual-templates instead of a crypto map. There the virtual-template will be used to create a ""vpn-interface"" where you can apply the ""ip nat inside""., Thank you for the reply Karsten. I guess I am using an older way to configure the EzVPN. I have attached the config from the hub router and the Branch ASA. You are correct I am using Crypto maps. I used what I have in the past and didn't know about virtual templates. I will have to read the link you provided so that I can try to figure out how the virtualtemplateswork. that will take a little time unless some suggestions can be made with the included configurations. Do you think that using virtual templates will do the job?  I would prefer split tunneling so that all traffic from the branch does not have to go down the tunnel. Thanks for any help this one has me stuck.

And the server certificate has to installed under the Identity certificate section. After doing this you need to replace the oldtrustpointwith the new one on the ASA's SSL interface. I have attached the screenshots as well. Regards, Aditya Please rate helpful posts and mark correct answers. Attachment: ssl_cert.png asdm-cert_.png, Hi Aditya, If you can explain me purpose of each cert that will be much appreciated? Regards Mahesh, Hi Mahesh, There are two types of (CAs), root CAs and intermediate CAs. In order for a certificate to be trusted, and often for a secure connection to be established at all, that certificate must have been issued by a CA that is included in the trusted store of the device that is connecting. If the certificate was not issued by a trusted CA, the connecting device (e.g., a web browser) will then check to see if the certificate of the issuing CA was issued by a trusted CA, and so on until either a trusted CA is found (at which point a trusted, secure connection will be established) or no trusted CA can be found (at which point the device will usually display an error). To facilitate this process of verifying a Â«chainÂ» of trust, every certificate includes the fields Â«Issued ToÂ» and Â«Issued ByÂ». An intermediate CA will show different information in these two fields, showing a connecting device where to continue checking, if necessary, in order to establish trust. Root CA certificates, on the other hand, are Â«Issued ToÂ» and Â«Issued ByÂ» themselves, so no further checking is possible or necessary in order to establish trust (or lack thereof). For example, if a certificate issued to Â«example.comÂ» and issued by Â«Intermediate CA1Â», and the visiting web browser trusts Â«Root CAÂ», trust may be established in the following manner: Certificate 1- Issued To: example.com; Issued By: Intermediate CA 1 Certificate 2- Issued To: Intermediate CA 1; Issued By: Intermediate CA 2 Certificate 3- Issued To: Intermediate CA 2; Issued By: Intermediate CA 3 Certificate 4- Issued To: Intermediate CA 3; Issued By: Root CA The visiting web browser trusts Â«Root CAÂ», and a secure connection can now be established. Since this process is often called Â«certificate chainingÂ», intermediate CA certificates are sometimes called Â«chained certificatesÂ». For enhanced security purposes, most end user certificates today are issued by intermediate certificate authorities. Installing an intermediate CA signed certificate on a web server or load balancer usually requires installing a bundle of certificates. Digital certificates provide digital identification for authentication. A digital certificate includes information that identifies a device or user, such as the name, serial number, company, department, or IP address. CAs are trusted authorities that ""sign"" certificates to verify their authenticity, thereby guaranteeing the identity of the device or user. CAs issue digital certificates in the context of a PKI, which uses public-key or private-key encryption to ensure security. For authentication using digital certificates, at least one identity certificate and its issuing CA certificate must exist on an ASA. This configuration allows multiple identities, roots, and certificate hierarchies. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa84/asdm64/configura...

Each end should have a common policy- something like this: crypto isakmp policy 10 authentication pre-share encryption aes hash md5 group 2 (may be crypto ikev1 or ikev2 policy if you have newercode) In any case, they have to have matching proposals to establish Phase 1 of the the IPsec tunnel. Yours don't appear to have matching Diffie-Hellman group identifiers (2 vs. 5 in the log). Reference., OK, so I kind of dropped back and punted. I created the profiles by hand, not wizard, and got tunnels up to both sites, but I had to use individual profiles and crypto maps.  For example, I created a policy for both Baltimore and Washington on the NYC ASA and a tunnel was established to whichever crypto map has the highest priority, but not both. I then went into the Baltimore crypto map and added the Washington IP address. The tunnel remained established. When I went into the crypto map and moved Washington to the top of the list, it builds a tunnel to Washington, but I only have traffic going from Washington to NYC, there is no traffic going from NYC to Washington.  Argh......  Thanks, I got TAC involved and they set me completely straight.  Rather than build a profile for each peer, I should have built a tunnel group for each peer and then added both peers to the same crypto map.  This is on me not ever setting up IPSec in an ASA.

376,376,ciscomanju1,"[user1, user2, user1, user2, user1, user2]","[Hi Manjunath, Please can you give a clearer description of the problem? What IP address are you trying to ping and from where are you initiating this ping? You can also post your sanitized ASA configs., Hi Adeolu, thanks for looking on my question, remote client inside ip subnet on firewall2 (L3 interface on ASA2) and i am initiating ping from firewall 1 (ASA1)- when i ping from pc i am able ping to the destination pc vpn is working, my question is why i am not able ping fromASA1 to remote ASA2 inside interface ip?, Hi Manjunath, Let me answer your question in two points: You cannot ping an ASA on another interface other than the one from which you are connected to the ASA from. As an example, ASA1 and ASA2 are connected via their ""outside"" interfaces. ASA1 (or any other deviceon that outside interface) cannot ping/access ASA2 on its (ASA2's) inside interface. The only time this can be overridden is over a VPN tunnel with the "" management-access "" command configured for the other interface e.g. management-access inside The ping traffic from ASA1 to aremote client behind ASA2 will not go over the VPN tunnel and as such will not be encrypted. This is because ASA1 will forward the traffic based on its routing table which probably has that route through its ""outside"" interface. Except this traffic is permitted by ASA2 (using ACLs), then it will fail. We can do this on routers by sourcing our ping from another interface but this will not work on the ASA., Thank you and as i understood that 1)initiating ping from ASA will not go over vpn and we will not be able ping. 2) for accessing remote ASA we can use the "" management-access "" this traffic will go over the vpn..  please let me know if i am wrong..., Yes, #1 is correct. I just want to clarify your point #2. If you want hosts behind ASA1to manageASA2 say on the ""inside"" interface, then you can use the management-access commandon ASA2.

378,378,KillswitchEngineer,"[user1, user2, user1]","[Hi Dean, You are right about the SLA stuff since only one link will be active at a time. On the branch ASA, you can apply the same crypto map to both the primary and backup circuit. You just use the SLA to determine how this branch ASA will reach the crypto map peer address (IP addr of the data center ASA).

381,381,alex.a.kotov@gmail.com,"[user1, user2, user1, user2, user1]","[Aleksey,  Clientless certificate validation was introduced in 9.0.1 release if memory serves well. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa90/release/notes/as... Under "" Clientless SSL VPN: Server Certificate Validation""  M., Can you expand a bit on that? I'm running 9.2(3) ASA This feature enhances clientless SSL VPN support to enable SSL server certificate verification for remote HTTPS sites against a list of trusted CA certificates.We modified the following commands: ssl-server-check, crypto, crypto ca trustpool, crl, certificate, revocation-check. So the way i read it it should be verifying https connection against a list of trusted certs? Is there a way to turn it on/off??, SSL Certificate Verification During the SSL handshake between ASA and remote ssl server, the remote server sends ASA a certificate to authenticate itself. The ASA verifies the server certificate against a list of trusted server CAs in trustpool and trustpoint of PKI subsystem. The verification includes the following items: Check the server certificate's validity period Check the server certificate against CAs in the trustpool and trustpoints Check the server certificate if it matches the domain name, hostname, or ipaddress of the server according to RFC2818, matching rules specified by RFC2459 Check the server certificate's key usage Check the server certificate's revocation status(CRL or OCSP) If all the verifications are passed, the server is authenticated. ASA proceeds with SSL handshake. Otherwise end users are warned of the server certificate problem and informed the reason. If ASA was configured with ""warn-on-failure"", end users can choose continue or not. If continue, the channel between ASA and remote server is still secure, but the identity of the server is untrustworthy. If configured with ""deny-on-failure"", the connections to remote https site were disconnected and end users cannot continue. Trustpool Management The trustpool management feature designates a single configuration object called a trustpool. The trustpool can be thought of as a special case of a trustpoint that will represent multiple known CA certificates.The feature includes a configurable policy that governs how the trustpool certificates are used.  Config ciscoasa(config-webvpn)# ssl-server-check? webvpn mode commands/options: deny-on-failure Disconnect the connection and show the denying page to end users on failure of verification warn-on-failure Show the warning page to end users on failure of verification, Yep that's exactly what i was missing thanks.  Now if i could piggy back on this, after i turned on the ssl-server-check deny-on-failure as expected it failed to load httpS site with self signed cert and gave the following error in the browser The certificate does not pass the criteria to be trusted. The security certificate is self signed So i created a new trustpoint and enrolled that self signed cert from terminal. But now on the clientless browser i get The website is not trusted because the whole certificate chain didn't pass verifications. and the logs just say Certificate chain failed validation. Generic validation failure occured. Since it's a self signed cert there's no chain per se it's just one CA. Any ideas? Or specific debug commands? Not finding much documentation on this  Check the server certificate's validity period &lt;pre>sh crypto ca certificates&lt;/pre> Shows Validity Date is good for next 5 years. ASA's clock is correctly set Check the server certificate against CAs in the trustpool and trustpoints Guessing it's doing it as without the trustpoint it gives a different error Check the server certificate if it matches the domain name, hostname, or ipaddress of the server according to RFC2818, matching rules specified by RFC2459 I do have correct ip in ""cn="" also browsers don't seem to have an issue with this once accepted. Looking into RFC2818 & 2459, Alex,  Perhaps trustpool operations? Is that CA cert part of trustpool?

I can get you the debugs in the morning. This is very strange, as when the ASA detects the interesting traffic, it initiates tunnel setup, and according to what I saw in the logs, it completes (goes ACTIVE). I see packets getting encapsulated/encrypted outbound, but nothing is coming back.  It's like the return traffic is getting black-holed. Could the ISP be blocking ESP? (it is on a protected government network), hi, i would need the snippet of your ASA config and debug output to see what's really going on. i suspect the crypto ACL aren't matched or properly configured. i haven't seen ISP blocking VPN traffic although i've heard china ISPs have started to do so., OK, this gets even stranger  After checking the ACLs and configs, I built two packet captures: one on the ASA, and one on the Router for icmp echo and echo-reply between hosts 172.25.91.67 and 192.168.20.20. I see the traffic go through the ASA as the tunnel is set up without errors. On the router, I see the tunnel come up and the icmp echo requests arrive and hit 192.168.20.20 The replies are sent back out through the tunnel by the router But the packets are never received by the ASA-they are ""lost in transit"" somewhere. So return traffic vanishes., Problem solved: The ISP was blocking ESP (protocol 50), but was allowing 500 through.

It's not something that you can change at the client level. On the client it shows up as ""Route Details"" under the VPN tab of the AnyConnect client details window., Thanks Marvin. I'm looking now at my Route Details and I see in the window ""Non-secured Routes (IPv4)"" with 0.0.0.0/0 and then below that ""Secured Routes (IPv4)"" with about 20-30 internal IP addresses (some 192.168's, and some 10.10's). I understand that there's nothing I can do at the client level, that's a shame. So when I make a request to the IT department, what I'm really hoping is that they copy/paste the connection (or make a new one) that somehow has something like 0.0.0.0/0 in the ""Secured Routes (IPv4)"" section, or *.*.*.*/* so that it can all go through.

If that's the case, then I won't ask, I don't know in advance which ones I'll need. That's why the wildcard example is what I'm looking for., If instead of ""tunnelspecified"" we use the keyword ""tunnelall"" value with the ""split-tunnel-policy"", that will push the 0.0.0.0/0 route to your client's session. So that's in effect the wildcard you're asking about., Rock and roll!! I'lljust point them to this thread:) Much appreciated.

385,385,matthew-gross,"[user1, user2, user1]","[Hi Matthew,  Actually that command works for that purpose, obviously you will need the AnyConnect PKG uploaded to the ASA.  If you have not set up any bookmarks or any use to the WebVPN clientless, it will automatically prompt the download of the AnyConnect, and yes you may use that FQDN to access it over a browser.  Best Practice set up authentication at least.  Please proceed to rate and mark as correct the post if it helped you!  David Castro,  Regards,, Thanks, that clears things up. But, what if you do have bookmarks or some kind of clientless functionality setup, would forcing the download install anyconnect then allow access to the clientless content?

The first problem is that Vlan2 (192.168.5.xx) can't get to the outside internet. But I know that the router has internet, because I can ping the external ip address.The 2nd problem is that I have a site to site set up but when I test the Site to site I get this error: the tunnel traffic destination must be routed through the crypto map interface. The following destination(s) does not have a routing entry in the routing table 192.168.2.0  I copied the config form this router from another working cisco 881, where everything is working. The only difference is that this router needs a site to site vpn connection.  My question is how can I get internet on vlan2 and who can I fix the site to site connection.  Here is the running config: Building configuration...

But even if it wasn't its not clear what you mean by traffic is meant for router C. If the IPSEC tunnel is established between router A and router C then router B won't have any crypto configuration so that step would be bypassed. It would simply forward the traffic to router C. The order of operations doesn't mean every step is applied on every router. It depends on what configuration you have on the router. So no IPSEC configuration on router B means no IPSEC processing. Jon, OK- Thanks. One more question. Let's take the first two steps of the process. If IPSec then check input access list decryption â for CET (Cisco Encryption Technology) or IPSec Assuming traffic going from router A to C. Why would router A see traffic as IPSec, is it not supposed to build the tunnel up first? OK let's assume the packet comes in when the IPSec tunnel is already up between router A and C then why step 2? Why does routerA have to decrypt that traffic?, Why does routerA have to decrypt that traffic? It doesn't. Notice the first step says "" if IPSEC.."" But the traffic coming in from the inside to router A isnot IPSEC ie. it is plaintext traffic. So it does not match and the decryption step is skipped. If you notice further down in the list just after NAT it then checks the crypto map and if the unencrypted traffic matches then it does a few other steps and then encrypts the traffic and sends it down the tunnel. Jon, OK. Makes perfect sense now. Thanks!, It should be mentioned that this OOO-table is pretty much outdated and not valid any morefor actual IOS-versions. Especially the ACL-check for IPsec-packets was removed in 12.3T, that was nearly a decade ago., Hi Karsten, Could you please point me to the latest OOO-table?

And on the ASA, that's what standard ACLs are used for. Although you can use an extended ACL for split-tunneling, using a standard ACL is the ""native"" ASA-way to handle that., Even if you use an extended ACL the ASA will ""convert"" the ACL (I use the convert statement very lightly) to a standard ACL. The source IP / subnet will be used for split tunneling and the destination will be ignored. So unless you configure the source IP with the destination network, the extended ACL will not work. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa91/asdm71/vpn/asdm_71_vpn_config/vpn_asdm_setup.html-- Please remember to select a correct answer and rate helpful posts]","[0, 2]",1,2015-03-29,12464271,1,3,I'm configuring RA IPSEC VPN on ASA and I would like to figure out whether it is possible to use extended acls as a part of split tunneling?

Of both ASAs, Andre, it did turn out to be a NAT issue after all, although I thought I checked that already. The correct NAT on the outside ASA, where the object vpn-fw-outside is the IP address of the outside interface of the VPN ASA. object network vpn-fw-outside     no nat (vpn-dmz,outside) static 209.x.x.x  Thanks, Bob, Hi. We have the same problem at our place. When anyconnect hits the outer firewall it nats fine to the inner firewall that runs the VPN and the inner replies through nat to the client. But then Anyconnectsee's the new inner address and tries to send traffic directly to that address which obviously doesn't work as its a rfc1918 address. Can you explain how you solved our problem. Thanks, Ok, so I have VPN/ASA appliance that has an outside subnet 192.168.1.0/30. The VPN appliance is.1 and the FW is.2. On the FW, this is an interface called vpn-inside. I take the 192.168.1.1 and NAT it on the FW to a public address, and a rule that allows VPN traffic from the FW outside to the vpn-inside interface. The Anyconnect client uses the public address on the outisde FW and traffic is sent to the inside VPN via the firewall rule. I just logged in and my Anyconnect shows the SERVER address as the public address, not the RFC1918 address. Configs: On the FW here is my interface facing the VPN appliance: interface GigabitEthernet0/3 description *** Conneciton to VPN Appliance G0/0 *** nameif vpn-dmz security-level 30 ip address 192.168.254.3 255.255.255.248 standby 192.168.254.4 object network vpn-fw-outside host 192.168.254.1 description *** VPN appliance outisde interface *** object network vpn-fw-outside  nat (vpn-dmz,outside) static 209.x.x.x access-list outside_access_in extended permit ip any object vpn-fw-outside   On the VPN appliance, nothing special is needed once you setup the standard Anyconnect Ipsec or SSL server. interface GigabitEthernet0/0 nameif outside security-level 0 ip address 192.168.254.1 255.255.255.248 standby 192.168.254.2 These NAT statement are important: nat (outside,outside) source static obj-AnyconnectPool obj-AnyconnectPool destination static obj-AnyconnectPool obj-AnyconnectPool nat (inside,outside) source static any any destination static obj-AnyconnectPool obj-AnyconnectPool no-proxy-arp route-lookup object network obj-AnyconnectPool subnet 192.168.253.0 255.255.255.0 description VPN users pool  I have my firewalls connected to switch so I created a port in the vlan they use and gave my PC a 192.168.254.x address (to bypass outside Firewall) and made sure VPN was working fine and routing correctly. Then I moved to the outside of the firewall and changed my IP to a public IP address and tested from the Internet. This way I knew if the problem was with my VPN appliance or my FW. Good luck, Bob, Thanks for your reply. After playing with it yesterday and this morning I found out that the natting worked just fine when you did it directly to an ASA.

The VPN tunnel portionworks fine for all equipment on both side (I can ping from laptop in 10.2.0.0 subnet to laptop in 10.1.0.0 subnet just fine, and vice-versa). Where I have my problem is if I want to ssh from laptop in subnet 10.2.0.0 subnet across the tunnel to control ASA on interface 10.1.0.1. or TFTP that ASA's configuration. This does not work in either direction.  I read in one post from a few yearsback to check that the tftp/ssh traffic is being routed across the tunnel, I assume that the tunnel traffic of 10.2.0.0 is all being routed due to the access-list statement so thatssh/tftp should be as well. I have tried all types of access list both on the crypto access list and a separate access-list placed on the inside and the outside interface to no success.  If needed, I Can diagram this out and attach if it would help to visualize it. -Jon, I just wanted to confirm that you were trying to manage the ASA. You need to use the management-access command to manage the ASA on another interface other than the one you accessed it through. In your case, you should configure management-access inside. Here's the Cisco guide: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa84/configuration/guide/asa_84_cli_config/access_management.html#wp1485100, I added the statement manage-access inside to both ASA's. No luck again. It gives the error time-out attempting to connect. This is the error I have been getting from the start on tftp. ssh just will not connect at all from a putty session., Ah you are right. I forgot about the Identity NAT configuration you have there. You need to add the route-lookup option behind your IdentityNAT configuration so it looks something like: nat (inside,outside) source static net-local net-localdestination static net-remote-DAY net-remote-DAY route-lookup Again you can find the explanation here: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa91/configuration/firewall/asa_91_firewall_config/nat_overview.html#pgfId-1286039, Thank you Adeolu,  I had tried that line before and it did not work, but for some reason I put it in again on both ends and it is now working for SSH. Not sure why but I will take it. Now just have to get TFTP working, it still want s to time out when crossing the tunnel even though I can ping from the ASA to the tftp server on the other side.-Jon, Hi Jon, I found the solution to this here: https://supportforums.cisco.com/discussion/10650026/how-copy-tftp-remote-site-through-vpn In your case, just enter the command tftp-server inside &lt;TFTP_SERVER_IP_ADDR> &lt;path or filename> For example: tftp-server inside 10.2.0.10 ASAconfig.txt, This is the command that I normally use and its still not working. Time's out every time. I guess I was wrong when I said yesterday that I had connection between the ASA and the tftp server. I still do not have any connection between the two and cannot ping either from the ASA->TFTP or from the TFTP->ASA.]",[4],1,2015-03-24,12460006,0,8,"OK, I am at my wit's end here.

I.e. make sure you have a separate IKE profile for your VPN users., Thanks Marcin for your replay, i did exactly as you said and as the link you send but still the issue exists, how can i config the spoke for the xauth with the hub to solve the issue?? final sh run is attached for both. thanks. Attachment: sh_run_hq_and_branch.txt, The config you attached does not have a new IKE profile. Check how it was implemented exactly in the doc I sent over, once that's done and it still does not workcompare the previous debugs, and try with a VTI configuration., Hi again Marcin, i used the same IKE profile as below but i changed the password. ok i`ll do and i`ll inform you back. crypto isakmp profile ccp-dmvpn-isakmprofile  keyring ccp-dmvpn-keyring  match identity address 0.0.0.0! crypto keyring ccp-dmvpn-keyring  pre-shared-key address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 key cisco123, Hi again Marcin, with new Ike profile i face the same issue and i need this to be solved. if i switch to use easy vpn in both!!! i removed the dmvpn config which is highlighted in bold above and in addition to above config iadded the below.

In this scenario, branch router already configured with dmvpn with other site using tunnel 0 and at the same time i want it to connect to the HQ using easy vpn. regards,, If you need urgent help, head to the folks in TAC. On support forums we try as much as we can to help people help themselves.  Can you show me the config from hub when you the two IKE profiles and the debugs?, Hi marcin again and sorry for being late due to war in our country (yemen). attached is the show run with new isakamp profile with debug and same for branch whos ip 78.137.83.54 hope this time you find something to solve my issue. regards, Attachment: hq_sh_run_and_debug.txt branch_sh_run_and_debug.txt, Mohammed, No probs, keep safe. The config you attached has a single IKE profile again. i.e. your DMVPN and ezvpn fall into same basket.  What you need is a clear separation. In the example you have crypto isakmp profile VPNclient match identity group hw-client-groupname client authentication list userauthen isakmp authorization list hw-client-groupname client configuration address respond which is then bound to: crypto dynamic-map dynmap 10 set isakmp-profile VPNclient reverse-route set transform-set strong  and separately a DMVPN IKE Profile: crypto isakmp profile DMVPN keyring dmvpnspokes match identity address 0.0.0.0 bound to your DMVPN IPsec profile: crypto ipsec profile cisco set security-association lifetime seconds 120 set transform-set strong set isakmp-profile DMVPN  You should apply the same logic here and clean up your current config (i.e. move the features you have applied on crypto map level to your new IKE profile).

What's bothersome from the log was that it appears that phase 2 is complete, but goes no further.: As I had mentinoed before, I've used 2 different ""known good"" templates to build the configuration, and I even re-entered the pre-shared key by hand on two occasions. Thanks again! Mark, Thank you so much! Your message pointed me in a different direction, and I found the problem I was having that I had shipped the remote location a replacement c831, which would build the VPN tunnel with the SECOND set of 2821s (the original c831 connected to the first set of 2821s), and I based all of my troubleshooting on that. However, the remote location NEVER swapped the c831s, and that completely explains why both routers were sending encrypted data, but never decrypted any! In effect, the remote c831 would begin the IKE with the 1st 2821, but because the 2nd 2821 was configured for the VPN, the 1st 2821 would just start the IKE process over again. The c831 never even got as far as the exchange of the IPsec PSKs. Thanks again for pointing me in a direction I hadn't thought to check, even though looking back on it, it was very obvious. Mark]",[0],1,2015-03-19,12456441,0,3,"Hi All, We've got 400+ remote sites that connect to our central location (and a hot site) using Cisco routers with IPSec/GRE vpn tunnels. We use a basic template for creating the tunnels, so there is very little chance of a misconfiguration on either router. The remote sites use Cisco 831s, the central sites use Cisco 2821s. There is one site where the GRE tunnels just refuse to come up. The routers are able to ping their public IP addresses, so it's not a routing issue, but the gre endpoints can not ping. There is no NATing involved, both routers directly access the Internet. The assorded show commands seem to indicate that the SAs are being properly built, but from the logs, it seems like the last part just doesn't get completed, and the GRE tunnels just don't come up.  From the attached log file, it appears that both ISAKMP & IPSEC SAs are created @ 00:25:14, then QM_PHASE2 completes @ 00:25:15. 00:25:15: ISAKMP:(0:10:HW:2):deleting node 1891573546 error FALSE reason ""QM done (await)"" 00:25:15: ISAKMP:(0:10:HW:2):Node 1891573546, Input = IKE_MESG_FROM_PEER, IKE_QM_EXCH 00:25:15: ISAKMP:(0:10:HW:2):Old State = IKE_QM_R_QM2 New State = IKE_QM_PHASE2_COMPLETE 00:25:15: ISAKMP (0:268435467): received packet from 208.XX.YY.11 dport 500 sport 500 Global (I) QM_IDLE    00:25:15: IPSEC(key_engine): got a queue event with 1 kei messages 00:25:15: IPSEC(key_engine_enable_outbound): rec'd enable notify from ISAKMP 00:25:15: IPSEC(key_engine_enable_outbound): enable SA with spi 1572231461/50 00:25:15: ISAKMP:(0:11:HW:2):deleting node-1931380074 error FALSE reason ""QM done (await)"" 00:25:15: ISAKMP:(0:11:HW:2):Node-1931380074, Input = IKE_MESG_FROM_PEER, IKE_QM_EXCH 00:25:15: ISAKMP:(0:11:HW:2):Old State = IKE_QM_R_QM2 New State = IKE_QM_PHASE2_COMPLETE 00:25:15: IPSEC(key_engine): got a queue event with 1 kei messages 00:25:15: IPSEC(key_engine_enable_outbound): rec'd enable notify from ISAKMP 00:25:15: IPSEC(key_engine_enable_outbound): enable SA with spi 310818168/50 I do have the log file from the remote router, and it's very long, so I've attached it.

404,404,anawaz,"[user1, user2]","[Hello Ajaz,  On this case if you want a VPN to work, it is a most to have phase 1 and phase 2 working and set up correctly on both sides.  Basically: Interesting traffic on phase 2 is completely required to have the VPN up. Now it should match up on both sides.  A VPN without interesting traffic would not come up and will not build a Security Association.  Please don't forget to rate and mark as correct the helpful Post!  David Castro,  Regards,, I also want to add to David's reply. Some keep-alive mechanisms depending on which firewall and configuration you are using either have phase 1 keep-alive, or complete end to end phase 2 keep-alive. I don't know the Cisco equivalent or if they even have one. Example of this with Juniper dead-peer-detection (DPD) only sends IKEv1/2 keep-alives, whereas VPN monitoring sends ICMP echo requests to keep the VPN up / or declare it dead. With DPD, there isn't exactly any interesting traffic probing, its just the IKE ""hello are you there"" messages. After a while, the vpn may go down due to lack of interesting traffic or have to re-negotiate phase 2. Though to create interesting traffic, you could set an ip sla for icmp end to end. You may have noticed in the past that VPN just goes down after a while (if you have had this setup) On the ASA there are three modes RE how the negotiation actually starts Answer-Only: Specifies that this peer only responds to inbound IKE connections first during the initial proprietary exchange to determine the appropriate peer to connect to. Bidirectional (Default): Specifies that this peer can accept and originate connections based on this crypto map entry. This is the default connection type for all Site-to-Site connections. [Only if interesting traffic is matched] Originate-Only: Specifies that this peer initiates the first proprietary exchange to determine the appropriate peer to connect to. For ASA Experts out there, please correct me if I'm wrong. Hope this helps Bilal]",[1],1,2015-03-16,12452991,0,2,"Really quick and easy one for VPN guru's out there....

So don't get nervous, I think it's quite ""normal""., Hi, I was unpleasantlysurprised when my local re-seller notified me that Cisco has refused issuing a anyconnect 4 licence for my serial number.

He mentioned that these devices were often produced for different markets or even that the deviceswere only ment for NFR. The risk of getting one of these devices is much higher when buying through resellers that are no official Cisco resellers. And yes, I know these resellers in Germany, their prices (with VAT) is often 20% less then my price without tax at the distribution. (Und Du kennst vermutlich den Spruch ""Wer billig kauft, kauft zwei Mal), Hi Karsten, Thank you for your answer.

If you only need two hosts then you could static policy NAT just for them but the network should work as well. So the CRYPTOMAP-11- 15 are used for the static NAT and then the 17 entry is used for your actual match address command in your crypto map entry. I don't know what the ""static (outside, inside)...

Thank you Mike, Okay, like I said you could do specific NAT statements per host but that would mean more config. It depends on how much you want to lock down the access. Also because they are static they work both ways so in theory they can make a connection to you as well but again that may not be a concern. What is wrong are the ""static (outside,inside)..."" commands. With static NAT it works both ways ie. going out and coming in so you don't needthose statements. Jon, Ok I got ya.

It might but it may not be a concern for you either way. You would need to look at the xlate table after you made the connection to know for sure. In addition it means every device in that subnet can potentially send packets to every device in the remote subnet but again may not be a concern. But apart from that yes your config looks fine to me. I would try with the first range and make a connection and then if it works check the xlate table to see exactly what IP it has picked. Jon, Thank you very much for putting up with my scattered posting. Work on 3 ASA upgrades and 2 other deployments and 2 NAT adds, so it has been crazy this week. I am doing all I can to not confuse the configs..:-)  How have things been with you? Great here and gearing up for NCAA basketball madness.  Mike, I like American football and watched most of the games this season including the SuperBowl.  I can watch baseball as well to be honest. But I could never get basketball, just seems like the dullest game, one team scores, then the other, then the other etc... game over! Guess if you went to a game though it would be very different. We Brits like our sports to have little or no scoring as you know with our football:-) I'm fine Mike, keeping busy. Only recently started posting back here and noticed some of the old timers had disappeared. Not quite the same as it used to be. I don't know what you mean about the NAT:-) I am just starting to get up to speed on post 8.3 finally and coming from an 8.2 or earlier background it makes absolutely no sense to me! This post was a refreshing change. Jon, I am the opposite with 8.2 and 8.3  come from studying for CCNP-Security I have issues and over think when doing 8.2  Yeah I don't watch the NBA too much but college Basketball is fun. Check out the Tarheels some time they play Duke tomorrow biggest rivalry in college basketball. The sport I wish we saw more of over here is Rugby... I miss watching my All Blacks  MIke, I have issues and over think when doing 8.2 I'm a bit too simple to over think things to be honest:-) Jon, Thanks... Have a great weekend and talk soon.  Mike, Hi Mike Long time since we have spoken. Hope you are well. When you say you only need to configure it on site A does that mean the connection will be always be initiated from that site? I ask because you could use dynamic policy NAT rather than static. I only have ever used static policy NAT for single IPs but it should work fine with a network as well. I don't know what this meant to do- static (outside, inside) 172.31.255.128 172.30.6.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 Jon, Jon, yes it has been a long time and I was hoping to say Hi as well.

I assume you have generated your certificates and you have root certificate (including intermediate if you have one) + device certificate on each routers? They're signed by the same CA authority? It's not mandatory but you can create a certificate map in order to check certificates. Here a sample config: (let's assume your CA domain-name is test.com and all certificates for hub and spokes have been enrolled today at 9.00am). You can add other options as you wish crypto pki trustpoint cacert! crypto pki certificate map certmap 10 valid-start ge Jun 21 2016 09:00:00 EDT subject-name co test.com crypto isakmp policy 10 encr aes hash sha256 group 5 auth rsa-sig crypto isakmp profile DMVPN  ca trust-point cacert  match certificate certmap crypto ipsec profile dmvpn set transform-set XXXX set isakmp-profile DMVPN!! It could be fragmentation issue (you can see it with debugs and/or wireshark). Just for testing, you can try to add globally the command: crypto isakmp fragmentation crypto ipsec fragmentation after-encryption Another thing, for DMVPN it's better to use mode transport as it saves 20 bytes overhead. Thanks PS: Please don't forget to rate and mark as correct answer if this solved your issue, Hi, first of all thanks for the response. Yes both devices have the CA cert and device certs in fact they are the only two certificates on each device, i removed the self-signed certs from both routers in case that was an issue. they are both signed by the same CA, the CA is a Microsoft CA and the certificates were generated from the 'Web Server' template. I've tried the fragmentation command suggested but no joy. Will inserting the set isakmp profile statement in to the ipsec profile disrupt the existing DMVPN spokes still using a PSK? one of the key themes of the lab is for us to be able to phase in certificates with minimal disruption. thanks again, Hi Yes inserting the profile will disrupt the actual DMVPN. Again it isn't mandatory. I always used user and/or ipsec template certificate from windows. Does your ntp is correctly configured? Does the time is synced correctly between hosts? Did you look on thebrouter certificate? Could you paste the show certificate (change confidential names) Thanks PS: Please don't forget to rate and mark as correct answer if this solved your issue, Hi, I've adjusted the templates to an IPsec V2 template, ntp is pointing to a public time source, both router clocks match within 5 seconds please see below the output from sh crypt pki cert commands on both routers thanks Hub Certificate  Status: Available  Certificate Serial Number (hex): xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Certificate Usage: General Purpose  Issuer:  cn=CA  dc=domain  dc=domain  Subject:  Name: hub.domain.domain  cn=hub.domain.domain  ou=OU  o=Org  c=Country  CRL Distribution Points:  ldap:///Path  http://path  Validity Date:  start date: 12:34:50 UTC Jun 22 2016  end date: 12:34:50 UTC Jun 22 2018  Associated Trustpoints: Trustpoint CA Certificate  Status: Available  Certificate Serial Number (hex): xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Certificate Usage: Signature  Issuer:  cn=CA  dc=domain  dc=domain  Subject:  cn=RootCA  dc=domain  dc=domain  Validity Date:  start date: 14:46:49 UTC Oct 3 2014  end date: 14:56:42 UTC Oct 3 2024  Associated Trustpoints: Trustpoint  Storage: nvram:Cer.Cer Spoke Certificate  Status: Available  Certificate Serial Number (hex): xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Certificate Usage: General Purpose  Issuer:  cn=CA  dc=domain  dc=domain  Subject:  Name: spoke.domain.domain  cn=spoke.domain.domain  ou=OU  o=Org  c=Country  CRL Distribution Points:  ldap:///Path  http://path  Validity Date:  start date: 12:37:04 UTC Jun 22 2016  end date: 12:37:04 UTC Jun 22 2018  Associated Trustpoints: Trustpoint  Storage: nvram:Cer.cer CA Certificate  Status: Available  Certificate Serial Number (hex): xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Certificate Usage: Signature  Issuer:  cn=CA  dc=domain  dc=domain  Subject:  cn=RootCA  dc=domain  dc=domain  Validity Date:  start date: 14:46:49 UTC Oct 3 2014  end date: 14:56:42 UTC Oct 3 2024  Associated Trustpoints: Trustpoint  Storage: nvram:Cer.Cer, Hi, i think this may be a time issue but. I'm not sure why..... the time stamp of the debug message is roughly an hour early and doesn't reflect the time of either of the routers (which are both correct) I've also checked the time on the CA which is correct. Both routers are set to automatically update for daylight savings time. I'm not sure if this has any impact? the debug error from the spoke router is Certificate received from x.x.x.x is bad: certificate invalid, Your certificates look good. Tge time is very important. Just set by using service timestamps the log time match your ntp clock. When everything is set correctly on time view, i would be very interested in getting all debugs. This issue you have is based on key or certificate not authencating together, coukd be mtu, could be another thing. Would you mind to provide all debugs and maybe a wireshark trace to see what's happening. Debugs are isakmp, ipsec and certificates as well. Thanks, Hi, managed to sort this issue out, left CRL checking on the spoke but the CRL's aren't published to an accessible URL in the lab.

423,423,Supportsib,"[user1, user2, user1]","[Hi, The difference between the webvpn and SSL VPN Client is the WebVPNuses SSL/TLS and port forwarding via a java app for application support, it also only supportsunicast TCPtraffic, no ip address is assigned to the client, and all theweb-browsing down the tunnelis done with an SSL web-mangle that allows us to stuff things into theSSL session. TheSSL VPN Client(Anyconnect) is a full tunneling client using SSL/TCP that installs anapp on the machine and envelopes the vpn traffic into the ssl session and also has an ipaddress assigned so the tunnel is two way, not uni-directional. It allows for applicationsupport over the tunnel without having to set up a port forward for each application. Anyconnect is a new generation client which replaced old vpn client and can be used for both ssl as well as IPSEC vpn.  For anyconnect licensing please go to the below link: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyc... Regards, Kanwal, Thanks Kanwal If I buy licence for anyconnect, can i use for webvpn also?  Thanks again, Hi, Yes you can but you would need anyconnect premium license and not anyconnect essentials.

When tunnel is not established, from server-side you never can initiate the tunnel or establish the tunnel from server-side but it is always from client side alone. Let me know if this what you want to achieve?  thanks Rizwan Rafeek., Dear Brother Rizwan, sorry for being late, Yes i aware your above info i want to ask you please if i can you my asa5510 to work easy vpn as server & client at the same time.??? means it act as a client to another asa5510 and as a server for asa5505- IS this possible??? OR configure both asa5510 site2site as both having static public ip address and at the same time it act as server for asa5505!!??? thanks again???, Hello Br. Mohammed, ""my asa5510 to work easy vpn as server & client at the same time.???"" Yes, it can function as a client and server at the same time. I never seen anyone doing it but manyyears of myunderstanding, I have no reason think why it cannot be, since both (client/server) configurations are independent from each other.  Your ASA function as a server uses the "" DefaultL2LGroup"" or ituses standard group-policy and tunnel-group are mapped to remote ASA-clients?  Thanks, Dear Rizwan, my current asa is function as easy vpn server and as you said it can work as client at the same time but when i try to add the command vpnclient server 82.114.183.53, i cant. it doesnt recognize the command vpnclient.??? is this mean it cant work as client at the same time?? if yes, what command i have to remove to make the command vpnclient recognized.??? is it the below or what? tunnel-group vpn type remote-access tunnel-group vpn general-attributes  thanks again,, Are you using server mode under the "" DefaultL2LGroup""?  Have you tried this command before "" vpnclient enable"", Hi Mr. Rizwan, yes i tried the command before ""vpnclient enable"" but it doesnt recognize the vpnclient command while the attached config exists. what do you mean by defaultL2LGroup, i need using the attached config to enable the vpnclient, is it possible or i have to remove the commands which relates to the server easy vpn like tunnel-group group-policy crypto maps ISAKMP policies transform-sets?????? Attachment: asa5510_final.txt, Try using dynamic DefaultL2LGroup in the place of group-policy and tunnel-group for remote vpn-client. Below URL shows, a simple example. On the server side, there is no need for group-policy and tunnel-group and remote-vpn-client side you would use a static tunnel to dynamic vpn-server. And so, your vpn-serverfunctions as a vpn-server and it can function has a static client as well. It is moreflexiblethan your current setup.  https://www.fir3net.com/Firewalls/Cisco/how-to-configure-a-cisco-asa-sit..., ok Rizwan, i`ll try doing it, thank for your permanent help. regards,, Dear Rizwan, can you help please regarding below: thanks in advance.

427,427,Mr.JinSin,"[user1, asker, user1]","[Hello,  This behavior seems to be that the SA (security Association) is not being created and when you try to bring the SA up, you are bring it up from the responder side, therefore the other side (HCM) it comes up because it is the initiator side.  Explanation: A LAN-to-LAN VPN connects networks in different geographic locations. In IPsec LAN-to-LAN connections, the security appliance can function as initiator or responder. In IPsec client-to-LAN connections, the security appliance functions only as responder. Initiators propose SAs; responders accept, reject, or make counter-proposalsâall in accordance with configured SA parameters. To establish a connection, both entities must agree on the SAs.  Now just to clarify this a little bit more, * when you ping from the HCM side, does the Singapo works? *  If not please go ahead and clear the SAs:   - clear crypto sa peer &lt;118.69.108.120>  - clear crypto isakmp &lt;ID number> * After that send traffic from your side and is that working? * Those debugs you sent is the process of the ASA to build the SA. * You can see this link:   https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/72491/understanding-ios-ipsec-a...

The unique session key protects the exchange from subsequent decryption, even if the entire exchange was recorded and the attacker has obtained the preshared and/or private keys used by the endpoint devices  Select the required Diffie-Hellman key derivation algorithm from the Modulus Group list box.

I obviously don't know a lot about what devices you are using, but if you are using ISE, there should be some type of MNT device (Monitoring and Troubleshooting)-- which is collecting the logs and, hopefully, sending them to some type of syslog aggregate collection tool (splunk?). Otherwise, there should be a device called a CAM (Clean Access Manager) that is collecting logs-- which may also be propagated to a syslog aggregate tool-- although with CAM's, you can pull the reports right out of them in a comma deliminated file (.csv) and go through them that way.-- The thing that gets me is that it happens to two users no matter what computer they try to connect from, no matter what network they connect from, and other users can authenticate and gain network access on those same devices.-- That is why it is rather perplexing.

Device 10.10.10.10 has a wrong gateway. Once I set the gateway to 10.10.10.1, my VPN client (original IP 192.168.254.111, VPN IP 10.9.0.151)can successfully access the inside network 10.10.10.0/24. However, my VPN client still cannot access any outside network. For instance, it cann't ping thefirewall default gateway 192.168.254.1. I didn't capture anypacket on the FW outside interface when 10.9.0.151 was trying to ping/telnet 192.168.254.1 and 8.8.8.8. The main purpose I set up the easyVPN is to provide VPN service for my friends in other country which has a very strict Internet policy. The PPTP/L2TP/OpenVPN are blocked there. So they don't need to access my internal network, they do need access toall public websites like youtube, facebook. I listed the routing table below when the easyVPN is established. Please help again. Thank you very much! pixfirewall# sh route S 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [1/0] via 192.168.254.1, outside S 10.9.0.151 255.255.255.255 [1/0] via 192.168.254.111, outside C 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 is directly connected, inside C 192.168.254.0 255.255.255.0 is directly connected, outside pixfirewall#, If remote-in vpn-clients need access to Internet, then you just need this line. global (outside) 1 interface nat (outside) 1 10.9.0.0 255.255.255.0  If remote-in vpn-clients need access tosubnets residing outside the your pix, then you would need a nat exemption like below.  access-list nat0-out extended permit ip 10.9.0.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.254.0 255.255.255.0 nat (outside) 0 access-list nat0-out outside  Hope that answers your question.

If your Linksys can forward traffic on protocol esp and ah then you have to set youPIX outside interface to be a dhcp client for your Linksys router and you might be able reserve an IP address off the Linksys for PIX.  Remove ""no ip address 192.168.254.171 255.255.255.0"" on your outside interface. interface Ethernet0 nameif outside security-level 0 no ip address 192.168.254.171 255.255.255.0 ip address dhcp setroute  You might want to address a second permit line on nat0-out as well. access-list nat0-out extended permit ip 10.9.0.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.254.0 255.255.255.0 access-list nat0-out extended permit ip 192.168.254.0 255.255.255.0 10.9.0.0 255.255.255.0  Hope this helps.

To eliminate Internet issue, let's focus on the PIX outside subnet 192.168.254.0/24. I have more than 20 hosts on this subnet. Once I vpn'ed in, I can't ping any host. That indicates I have no access to th outside network. Once my vpn IP can ping the outside subnet, I believe it can ping the internet IP like 8.8.8.8 as well., did you disconnect from the vpn session after adding the new ACL to outside interface and try it again?  disconnect from vpn session and try again and if does not work apply this line.  same-security-traffic permit intra-interface  show crytop ipsec sa. Please post this output. thanks, Yes, I disconnect VPN session first every time beforeI try the new command. Great progress!

M., Thanks Marcin This is a good help. But also poses some new questions. It indicates the ISRG2/891 support ECDH and ECDSA in software. Does this rule out using them in a production environment? They are supposed to be stronger and more efficient, but i can't judge their performance. AdHoc testing ECDH/ECDSA on an 891 doesn't seem to affect it much.  Or putting it a different way.. What are the strongest ikev2 / ipsec encryption algorithms with the highest performance for 891/ISRG2/ISRG3/ASR1002x.? Assuming one of these platform will be the lowest common denominator. My preference is to use GCM and Elliptical Curve where possible   Also.. I'd like to totally disable ikev1/isakmp. There is no isakmp config and I've deleted the default isakmp proposals. Is that it?, What you want to avoid is encrypting your traffic in software. But since you want to use GCM... that's not a problem. IKE can be handled in software....you might see you CPU shootup every time IKE needs to re-negotiate (every 1 day by default)...whenever you re-do your IPsec SA (everyhour by default).  To disable IKEv1: no crypto isakmp enable tested on my 15.4T... disabled it and checked that my IKEv2 session still came up after clearing;], Thanks Marcin Re encryption perf- Perfect thank you  Re disabling isakmp I tried 'no crypto isakmp enable' on my ASR running 3.13 and 891 running 15.4(3)M New sessions wouldn't start and existing sessions dropped when the ipsec sa expired.

Can you please re-read my post, and if you are able, respond to my questions with more than just a generic answer?  Thanks!, Hi David, No the license for the Any connect is not included in the licensing of your ASA 5545 unless you have purchased the license for it. Your license for Anyconnect should have concurrent number of users that you can use for Anyconnect, All* ASAsinclude two ""free"" AnyConnect Premium licenses. That is designed primarily for evaluation as most enterprises require more than two concurrent remote access users. However, if that's all you require it is fully functional and free. It was designed around the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 3.x and earlier offering. As of 4.0, there is a new licensing model for AnyConnect. It is explained in the AnyConnect Ordering Guide. While it is not currently enforced by technical means, use of AnyConnect 4.0 requires having a license to do so. For some additional supporting documentation as you originally requested, also see the "" Feature Licenses "" section of the ASA Configuration Guide.  * A few models don't support remote access VPN and either don't have the feature available or are unable to use the license- e.g. ASA 1000v and an ASA operating in multiple context mode., Marvin,  Thank you for the reply.  It was very specific and to the point.  I appreciate the information, and it was very helpful.

You can verify it by--> Show crypto ipsec sa ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Regarding Transform Sets: A transform set is an acceptable combination of security protocols, algorithms and other settings to apply to IP Security protected traffic,During the IPSec security association negotiation, the peers agree to use a particular transform set when protecting a particular data flow  Selecting Appropriate Transforms  The following tips may help you select transforms that are appropriate for your situation:  â¢ If you want to provide data confidentiality, include an ESP encryption transform.  â¢ If you want to ensure data authentication for the outer IP header as well as the data, include an AH transform. (Some consider the benefits of outer IP header data integrity to be debatable.)  â¢ If you use an ESP encryption transform, also consider including an ESP authentication transform or an AH transform to provide authentication services for the transform set.  â¢ If you want data authentication (either using ESP or AH) you can choose from the MD5 or SHA (HMAC keyed hash variants) authentication algorithms. The SHA algorithm is generally considered stronger than MD5, but is slower.  â¢ Note that some transforms might not be supported by the IPSec peer.  â¢ In cases where you need to specify an encryption transform but do not actually encrypt packets, you can use theesp-nulltransform.  Suggested transform combinations:  â¢ esp-desandesp-sha-hmac  â¢ ah-sha-hmacandesp-desandesp-sha-hmac  Phase 1 creates the first tunnel, which protects later ISAKMP negotiation messages.

I'm trying to set up Anyconnect on an ASA 5505 running software 9.0(1) / ASDM version 7.1(1)52. I have followed various guides online (all pretty much the same)using the Wizard. The only difference in my case is that I cannot use port 443 as it's already in use for ActiveSync. So I want to use 444 instead. To achieve this I run the anyconnect VPNwizard as per instructions, and afterwards go to Configuration>Remote Access VPN>and change the port settings here (https and dtls ports to 444 from 443). what happens then on the client side: I can browse to the router/site: eg https://123.123.123.1:444 and this brings up the login/password screen, it accepts credentials as it should, and goes through the procedure of downloading the client. All fine so far. When the anyconnect client tries to connect it issues a warning about the certificate (that's ok as I've only used self-signed for now) so I have the option of connect anyway which I chose. It then proceeds to try and connect and just sits there before eventually crashing the client. On the ASA side of things then I've looked at the log while this is happening and it goes through the following steps: 1 it initiates the handshake, then I can see there is a tcp connection buildup from my IP to port 444, followed immediately by Teardown. The buildup/teardown keeps repeating until the client crashes. So in summary I can get as far as the ASA (to enter credentials,download the client etc). The client can get as far as recognising that the cert isn't trusted, which I can acknoweldge and move on from, and it's beginning the authentication but just stops there. I am lost as to where to go from here. I'm wondering if it's anything to do with the fact Im not using 443.

I'm trying to set up Anyconnect on an ASA 5505 running software 9.0(1) / ASDM version 7.1(1)52. I have followed various guides online (all pretty much the same)using the Wizard. The only difference in my case is that I cannot use port 443 as it's already in use for ActiveSync. So I want to use 444 instead. To achieve this I run the anyconnect VPNwizard as per instructions, and afterwards go to Configuration>Remote Access VPN>and change the port settings here (https and dtls ports to 444 from 443). what happens then on the client side: I can browse to the router/site: eg https://123.123.123.1:444 and this brings up the login/password screen, it accepts credentials as it should, and goes through the procedure of downloading the client. All fine so far. When the anyconnect client tries to connect it issues a warning about the certificate (that's ok as I've only used self-signed for now) so I have the option of connect anyway which I chose. It then proceeds to try and connect and just sits there before eventually crashing the client. On the ASA side of things then I've looked at the log while this is happening and it goes through the following steps: 1 it initiates the handshake, then I can see there is a tcp connection buildup from my IP to port 444, followed immediately by Teardown. The buildup/teardown keeps repeating until the client crashes. So in summary I can get as far as the ASA (to enter credentials,download the client etc). The client can get as far as recognising that the cert isn't trusted, which I can acknoweldge and move on from, and it's beginning the authentication but just stops there. I am lost as to where to go from here. I'm wondering if it's anything to do with the fact Im not using 443.

Let us assume that S connects to router R1 which connects to router R2 which connects to router R3 which connects to router R4 which connects to D. Let us also assume that a GRE tunnel has been configured between R1 and R4 and that the trace route will go over that GRE tunnel.  The trace route from S will get a response from R1 and from R4 but will not get response from R2 or R3. This is because the trace route packet leaving R1 will be encapsulated in GRE.

Another way of looking at this question is to remember that trace route works by controlling the Time To Live.

You can link external IP addres to ASA by the line at 3925: ip nat inside source static [IP_ASA] [External_IP] extendable 2. You can use PAT if you have only 1 external IP address.

Go to the Start Screen of Windows 8.1 and look for the Cisco Anyconnect Secure Mobility Client icon (or just type it on the Start Screen). 2. Right click the icon and select 'Open file location'. 3. Right click the Cisco Anyconnect Secure Mobility Client (Shortcut) and select 'Properties' 4. Select the 'Compatibility' Tab. 5.

Also, you cannot terminate remote access VPN on a multi-context ASA. So doing what you ask with a single ASA is a bit problematic. If you had unique internal addresses, the subinterfaces would work fine. Since it sounds like you have a virtualization infrastructure, have you considered using the lower cost ASAv? You could spin up multiple instances, one per VRF. Each knows only about the public address space and its respective assocated VRF., Hello Marvin, thanks for the response. I did think about the ASA 1000v briefly, but when I found release notes for what I thought was new version (turns out this is a couple year old version, from 2012: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa87/release/notes/as... ) it it listed VPN remote Access as not supported "" Includes Remote Access, Clientless (SSL) Access, Multi-site (SSL) Access, Easy VPN on the ASA 5505, VPN Phones, AnyConnect Essentials, and AnyConnect Mobile.)"" Looking again I found newer release notes and it does look like it has since been added in as supported?  The other option I was looking at this morning was using something like an ASR 1000 for the IPSEC site-to-site VPN tunnel, then a separate ASA as needed for user access, but I'll have to give the ASA 1000v a closer look for sure., Denis, Note the ASAvis a different product that the ASA 1000v. The latter is positioned as an internal data center firewall and thusit does not support the features your noted. The ASAv was just released a couple of months ago and it does indeed support remote access VPNs. As noted on its data sheet, "" Cisco ASAv supports site-to-site VPN, remote-access VPN and clientless VPN functionalities as supported by physical Cisco ASA devices.

That's all the licensing you need. Those licenses are for the device, not by user count. The license is installed on the ASA Concurrent users connected via VPN Not that I know of  Hope it helps., Thanks for the reply, Although I thought for VPN phones I would need the VPN phone license as well.. Which requires Premium SSL license, if I am not mistaken. Also I checked in CCW and the pricing for the new licenses really is less than the AC3.5 licensing..  For a 5515 the Premium-SSL-50 is priced at about 4.000USD For AC4.0 the 100 User PLUS license (3y term) is priced at 200USD, the perpetual is at 630USD. Do I have a mistake in my assumptions?, Are you talking VoIP Phones or iphone/android phones? A good place to get info on licensing is the Partner Helpdesk. http://www.cisco.com/web/partners/tools/helponline/index.html, I really meant Cisco hardphones. I raised a ticket at the PDI, still no response after about 1 week..., If you want the phone itself to be the remote access VPN endpoint then, yes- you need the VPN phone license which in turn requires AnyConnect Premium (for 3.x installations) AnyConnect Plus(for 4.x) does include ""VPN functionality for PC and mobile platforms, including per-app VPN on mobile platforms and Cisco Phone VPN "" (reference the January 2015 version of the AnyConnect 4.0 Ordering Guide), I have been looking for information on Anyconnect 4.0 and licensing and found this thread. All of Patricks questions have not been answered. In particular is this point. How is the number of users determined (i.e. AD groups, local accounts) I cannot find anywhere how the ASA manages the technical details of ""users"" and matching them up with licenses. If the user database is not on the ASA, then how can it know the potential user count. What if I have over time connected 50 different users and I used up my licenses, but 25 of those users are no longer in the AD or LDAP or ISE or ACS... Also what if I have Premium and now I need more, I am stuck with purchasing AC 4.0 because Premium is EOS. I haven't check the price of the migration license yet. Can I run with my Premium user license and add AC 4.0 licenses for my new users. Oh but I can't have AC 4.0 and AC 3.0 on the ASA at the same time. I'm getting a headache due to lack of info and details., Garry, AnyConnect license use is based on concurrent active users. Once a user is no longer connected, he or sheno longer consumes a license. That is the same for both AC 3.x and 4.x With 4.x, agiven user connecting via several devices simultaneously (i.e. PC plus mobile device(s)) only consumes a single license. If you need to add Apexusers after the AC 3.x End of Sales then yes- you need to migrate your existing AC Premium to Apex (via a no-costmigration license good for a 3 year term)andadd new Apex term-based licenses as a separate line item. Hope this helps., Hi Marvin, I'm not sure that this is true for AC 4.x. According to the ordering guide ""The number of Cisco AnyConnect licenses needed is based on all the possible unique users that may use any Cisco AnyConnect service."" So number of licenses is the number of users who are able to use the AnyConnect service. With 3.x the number of licenses is the number of simultanious users. This is what Cisco told me yesterday., I've gotten conflicting information from Cisco myself on this one. I don't see how ""all the possible unique users"" could ever be enforced. Example 1. Say I have an employee that's using AC. The employee leaves the company, is removed from the authentication server, and never uses AC again. By the Cisco licensing logic you cited, they would still need to be licensed. Example 2. Consider the case where we use a sharedadmin account for IT staff to log in remotely. Only one username authenticates but perhaps 3-4 users are involved. Do I require 1 or 3-4 licenses?, you're absolutely right. Cisco told me that the license won't be enforced. They say it's a trust license. We run a VPN service for a university with students coming and leaving. With 3.x we ran the service with a view 100 concurrent licenses. What number do I have to purchase with 4.x? 27.000 students + 4.000 staff?, I've relayed this message and added my own input to the Cisco product manager during Cisco Live last week. One thing I did get is that they really mean""total unique users"" to mean unique within a given period- 90 days was the rule of thumb. However that's not reflected in any of the ordering guide collateral provided to partners at this time. We'll see if it results in any change to the scheme., Marvin, Did you ever find out how total unique users is enforced? If I'm authenticating using LDAP does the ASA keep track of what users are using licenses? Is there any way to manually remove a license from a user? And what about splitting the licenses between two entry points into a network. I've got two ASAs at different entry points into the network: do they somehow communicate used licenses or are do they split the licenses half and half?, It's not enforced via any technical means. It's strictly the ""honor system"" at this point. AC 4.x activation keys for a single purchase may now be requested and applied to both your ASAs at different entry points. (i.e, The PAK with AC 4.x can be redeemed more than once.)]","[4, 9]",1,2015-02-11,12422691,1,13,"Hi all, I have some quick question where I can't find a clear answer for: A customer wants to buy a new ASA for a showroom.

Also in your split tunnel config under your group-policy for VPN you should have an ACL that matches the split-tunnel that ACL should have look something like access-list VPN_splitTunnelAcl extended permit ip 10.200.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.22.0 255.255.255.248. I am not sure if that is the correct ACL as you have 2 referenced for VPN, also you will want to make sure you do not NAT traffic from the voice subnet 10.200.1.0 to the VPN subnet 192.168.22.0  Let me know if that makes sense Thanks, FItz, Thanks for the reply.  I do have a few questions though. The route inside command are you saying that needs to placed on my Layer 3 switch attached to the ASA? From the switches you can talk ping across vlans as they are routed interfaced on the layer 3 switch. The traffic just gets dropped when trying to ping to the 10.200.X.X vlan from the VPN client, No, you want to place the route inside command on the ASA, because the ASA has no knowledge of that subnet so you need to tell it how to get to that subnet by the route inside command, whatever switch is the gateway for the 10.200.1.0 network should be the IP you point the route inside command to so it should look something like "" route inside 10.200.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.193.5.2 &lt;--------- 10.193.5.2 is just an example you would use whatever IP address is on the switch that does the routing for the network.  That should allow access from the VPN pool to the 10.200.1.0 network, I went ahead and issued the route inside 10.200.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.193.5.1 command in the ASA and I am still unable to ping that vlan from the VPN.   EDIT  From the ASA I am able to ping the 10.200.1.0 subnet just not from the VPN, Ok you get a show running config of the ASA and send it me me or post it here, you can leave out the IP address of the outside interface and any passwords for security purposes.

Mike, ah ok, makes sense now, still no change though unfortunately., i'm not sure if this is relevant or not but i did a sh ipsec sa on site b and it is showing pkts encaps, encrypt, and digest but nothing on decaps or decrypt i ran the same command on site a and it is the exact opposite, it has pkts decaps, decrypt, and verify, but nothing in encaps, encrypt, or digest i compared this to a known working vpn between two other cisco asa's (running pre-8.3 so they can't help me in this case) and on the known working one there is packets in both of those areas.  Could this indicate that site b sends and encrypts and site a recieves and decrypts, site a is not able to send and encrypt?, After look at the stats on the sh ipsec sa i figured that the tunnel is getting traffic through but the asa 8.3 isnt' sending, did a reboot on it and that fixed the issue finally, i do know the crypto helped though becuase that wasn't the case until i did that, thank you for you help., Glad I was able to help. One more thing that I do is remove the ikev2 if both sides don't support it or use it. I have had co-workers have it do odd things when one side has ikv2 ""stuff"" configured but is not using it. Based on that you could remove tunnel-group 0.0.0.0 ipsec-attributes no ikev2 remote-authentication pre-shared-key ***** no ikev2 local-authentication pre-shared-key *****  Just remove the two lines with the ""no"", do NOT remove the tunnel-group.  But if it is working you could just leave it.  Mike]",[2],1,2015-02-10,12422246,0,7,"Hello, I am setting up a site to site vpn tunnel between two locations. Both have cisco ASA 5505's running different version, i'll explain in more detail below. so far I have been able to get the tunnel to come up but I cannot get it to pass traffic, I have been working at this for days now and have not been able to figure out why it won't pass traffic. Needless to say the client is PO'd over the fact that their VPN isn't up and they have been having to do things by hand.

They use local authentication as the second authentication factor but you could just as easily use AD or LDAP or RADIUS as your AAA server., Hello, Marvin Rhoads. Do you know if it possible to also check user group at AD when ASA is checking AD Authentication (with CA authentication for a 1 phase)? What i mean is to let user connect only if he mapped to some specific group at the AD (for example to ""Cisco_VPN"" group).  to Leo Jensen. If you want use CiscoVPN instead of AnyConnect you can try my configuration: https://supportforums.cisco.com/discussion/12397696/easyvpn-asa-certific... But I used Cisco Router as CA, so you can just change url of trast point at ASA configuration to your MS CA server. Best Regards., AllertGen, If I understand your question correctly, I believe you are asking about what Cisco calls "" Placing LDAP Users in a Specific Group Policy "". The link explains how to do this., Hello, Marvin Rhoads. Thanks a lot for your answer. It's close but it's not it. Here is what I'm tolking about: I want to do so that if user has a membersip at this group he could connect via VPN. I made this commands at my ASA device: ldap attribute-map ADLDAPAttMap map-name memberOf Group-Policy map-value memberOf CN=VPN1,CN=Cisco_VPN VPN1 map-value memberOf CN=VPN2,CN=Cisco_VPN VPN2 exit aaa-server AD_LDAP (if) host [AD_server] ldap-attribute-map ADLDAPAttMap exit tunnel-group VPN1 general-attributes authentication-server-group AD_LDAP exit tunnel-group VPN2 general-attributes authentication-server-group AD_LDAP exit And the main problem at the line: ""tunnel-group-map enable rules"". Without this line CA authentication does'n works, but AD authentication works well (with pre shared ike authentication). And when I'm using this command CA authentication works well, but AD authentication accepts any user from AD. So I'm stuned with this moment.

Would require to setup a separate tunnel-group or assign different parameters via DAP/RADIUS/whatever, including a different IP address pool if you want to do hair pinning for some traffic. That's probably the ""easiest"" way. Ad2. Couple of challenges. Yes, you can enable anyconnect service on multiple interface, not only outside. Think about traffic flow though.Due to architectural choices of ASA (at least they were in place two years back) you will not be ableto communicate_with_ ASA on a different interface than you're on right now, with the exception of managment-access.

I don't think it's going to end up working favorably...never tried this.  I don't really understand the need for 'another site-to-site tunnel' though. Theoretically, I could be wrong here, there is only need for one IKE phase 1 tunnel. There can be multiple IKE phase 2 tunnels communicating through that tunnel at the same time though.  Why not leave the peer relationship as it is, expand your (and his) internal/external cryptos, and go from there. ASA 8.4 supports twice nat-- which could be a solution if he's having issues on his end.  And to be honest, even the ASA 5505's that I've helped configure have all been on the remote side, and I'm pretty sure that every single one of them existed solely for the purposes of a single site to site to my organization.  Maybe explain WHY he wants to do what he wants to do also?, There are several things that we do not know which could impact the answer to the question.  The ASA5505 should certainly support two site to site tunnels, as long as the tunnels go to different destinations. Two tunnels from the same 5505 to the same destination peer would not work. So does the customer intend the second tunnel to terminate on a different device?  Where you may have more problem is in the extra vlan on the 5505. The 5505 restricts vlans on the 5505. It supports full functionality on two vlans and allows a third vlan as DMZ but imposes some restrictions on it. So depending on what the customer wants to do with the third vlan it might work or it might not work.  HTH  Rick, I resolved this issue by taking one of the ports on ASA and placing it into a separate vlan. Assigned it an ip range that customer wanted and updated my tunnel phase 2 crypto to reflect the new subnet on both ends.

If so then probably you need to add some things to the access list. Does the current site to site use a tunnel and encrypt everything that goes through the tunnel. If so then you probably need to add routing logic that ensures that this traffic is forwarded through the tunnel.  HTH  Rick, Rick  Thank you for the response.  We use a crypto map and acl..  Please forgive my ignorance, I am confused by this ""Does the current site to site use a tunnel and encrypt everything that goes through the tunnel""  Its a vpn tunnel so arn't all packets encrypted/decrypted?, Perhaps it is a question of terminology or perhaps a question of perspective in how you define tunneling. If this is implemented on an ASA then pretty much the only option is a crypto map and an access list. But if this is implemented on an IOS router then there are options like VTI where you just configure the tunnel, there is no crypto map and there is no access list. Simply anything that is routed through the tunnel gets encrypted.  So what I am asking about is what mechanism do your site to site tunnels use?  HTH  Rick, Rick  Thanks again for your guidance.

BR, Hi Thanks for your reply:-)  Yip both VPN's go via the same ASA firewall.  Technically using the same browser too (Firefox or IE 10) Java version 7 update 55 â only difference is just going through the vpn portal to access the bookmarked intranet verses logging on via AnyConnect client then accessing the intranet direct from local laptop (which works fine) Looking at some tests it would appear that my browser and Java is fine on my laptop â as I can access everything as it should direct from laptop to website â no issues I have added everything I can think of to the trusted sites / compatibility settings etc â so I am unsure if this an ASA issue or Intranet issue â possibly some compatibility issues between the portal browser and website  The customer would like to use the clientless portal on the ASA similar to Citrix to access their intranet rather than roll out the VPN client and access the intranet direct. Regards, James, Hi James,  when you access the application webpage directly or through anyconnect it is direct interaction between your browser and application server but when you access it using clienteles portal of ASA it is connection proxied by ASA. ASA uses rewrite functions to hide the actual urls and sometime some application / pages are not re-written properly and they are not rendered correctly on the browser. check if the ASA version is compatible with the application. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/compatibility/asa-vpn-...  You can use httpwatch tool to compare the HTTP requests and responses when accessing the application directly vs accessing it over clientless VPN and then open a TAC case to address the rewrite issues.

There are (3rd party)clients which will be able to connect to ezvpn, along with legacy Cisco VPN client, but AC is not that. BTW.... it's not UDP/50, it's IP protocol 50 (and/or sometimes 51)- ESP (and/orAH). You do not need TCP and UDP 443 for IPsec, but you might need them for SSL. And seriously... 1700 series? Wow, that's some 'retro' kit:-)Support finished 6 years ago. M., The Anyconnect client should pull down its configuration from the router right? If I understand correctly, it should pull from the config from the client settings., Grant  You had another post in this forum about using crypto map on a 1700. Am I correct in assuming that this question and that question are related?  You are correct that the AnyConnect client is designed to pull its config from the device that terminates the VPN. I agree with Marcin that the 1700 is pretty old for supporting this type of VPN. I have done lots of site to site VPN on 1700 routers and it worked quite well for that. But I am not familiar with 1700 supporting AnyConnect based Remote Access VPN. Do you have sources that indicate that AnyConnect VPN is supported on 1700 routers?  HTH  Rick, I'll double check tomorrow but when I started this I looked it up and the feature navigator said my IOS supported easy vpn server, which I assumed meant it supported cisco easy vpn. From what I could then figure out cisco easy VPN is no longer in service and was replaced by anyconnect. Since I couldn't find anything concrete on the subject I assumed Anyconnect would work with easy VPN server. Though I realized today that easy VPN server seems to be a gui application rather than something configured on the cli. By the way, thanks for the help. Things are coming together, but understanding IPSec, isakmp, all the features of iOS, etc has been a very steep learning curve lol. The overloaded terminology was particularly confusing at first., Grant,  ezvpn is very much alive and supported but it's a IKEv1-based technology. Anyconnect however will not work with it, it's using SSLorIKEv2, only.  ezvpn is a blanket term for remote access VPNs, whether hardware or software endpoints connecting in a framework (typically)with authentication using xauth (""user"" authentication). It can be configured using crypto maps or DVTI.  M., That's helpful to know that ezvpn is just a blanket term for a remote access VPN. In the documentation that was unclear. I just picked up a 866vae and I'm going to try it with that. It very well might be possible to support a remote access VPN on the 1700, but I just can't find any documentation for it and none of the commands match up. I can't tell what version of IKE it is using, but I assume it's just implicitly v1. I'll just wait for the new router and give it a go on that one., Grant, IKEv2 is tad more complicated, you might want to starts with AC + sslvpn instead.

Crypto in IOS is egress feature (i.e. has to be enabled on egress interface of cleartext), no go for enabling crypto on interface where MPLS is running (AFAIK). PE-PE encryption would be rather a SP feature than a enterprise one. M., Hi Marcin, thanks for getting back to me.I the Setup you see i'd like to encrypt customer data from one site to the other. I believe the problem is that there is no outgoing interface for the vrf on my router. I attached the config of the router as well.  regards Alex Attachment: cfg_sitea.txt cfg_siteb.txt setup.jpg, Hey Alex,  This interface FastEthernet0/0.800 is it where you'd expect clear text or encrypted packets to arrive? Looks like it's the cleartext.  Indeed you'd need to have some VRF awareness in that setup to make it work, and there's no way you can have ivrf=X and fvrf=global with crypto maps.  M., Hey Marcin,  that's right, traffic from the LAN segment is arriving at Fa0/0.800. I guess with this setup there is no way to encrypt the traffic for the vrf and i have to put another router between the switch and the router facing the providers backbone. Any other way to provide encryption through the MPLS cloud? It should be scalable, at the end i'll have around 10 vrf in 9 different sites which require a mesh topology. thanks in advanced. Alex, Alex, GetVPN is a feature meant for CE routers not PEs, unless something changed (I'm mostly out of security space for a year) you're going to have a hard time overcoming the limitations. There was a big plan to have crypto maps working as ingress feature, which most likely would have worked pretty nicely here, but I think that with advent of logical interfaces it was sidelined. But anyway we're interested in things that work. You can check on the the SP side of this forums whether they have a solution for PE-PE encryption or ""encryption as a service""... there's quite a few discussion on the interwebz, but I have not seen anything meaningful come out of it. M., Hey Macin,  thanks for the hints. I will continue searching a solution.

488,488,rschember1,"[user1, user2, asker]","[The good news is that with a working VPN, thehard part is already done. You just need to tweak it a bit to allow the additional subnets across the tunnel. A site-site VPN relies on a numbered access-list to determine what traffic is ""interesting"" and put into the tunnel for the distant end. We also exempt that traffic from NAT using anaccess list (which may or may not be the same one- yours do it both ways- see below).

Jose, You are doing it correct...basically the output shows that no such file exists on your system...also the directory is missing and you are saying that the application is also removed from the ""Application"" folder...so IMO the application is gone so you should be able to re-install. However, you aren't able to re-install so there is still something left that is preventing you from doing it...unfortunately, I am out of ideas at this point:(Perhaps someone else can chime in... Otherwise, you can maybe try contacting Apple support or take the Mac to an Apple store and have the guys there take a look. Last but not the least, you could try some third party app remover like AppCleaner and see if that can help you out., Neno, Thank you so much for all your work.  JosÃ©, No problem.

What for are you using NAT for L2TP-VPN? Split tunneling is helping your users go to internet direcrly so you don't need to use NAT. Also it can be a source of the problem because NAT works before site-to-site VPN.

491,491,WesSLF2008,"[user1, user2, user1, user2, user1, user2, user2, user1]","[Hello, Wes Smith. Are you planning to use the same Certificats for RED and BLUE? If it'll be not the same certeficate you can try use a OU to separate them., Hi As far as I know, the spokes can only have one identity and it gets uses for bothDMVPN clouds This means they have common attributes for both tunnels The same domain name (ie br1. something.com) The same email domain (br1@ something.com) Random Tunnel IP addresses (For the external/Internet Iface) The same FVRF And the same Certificate authority I'm really stumped on how one would ever have a spoke use this profile based tunnel selection feature to identify which profile should be used for an incoming ike request.  Attachment: 2015-01-14_21-52-04.png, Hi, Wes. At each branch you have 2 different PKI Certificates (i think you have:)). Each for every cloud. At first certificate you can make a OU=RED and at the second OU=BLUE. And at the each hub router you can add lines: crypto ca certificate map CERF_MAP_RED 10 subject-name attr ou eq RED exit crypto ca certificate map CERF_MAP_BLUE 10 subject-name attr ou eq BLUE exit crypto isakmp profile RED match certificate CERF_MAP_RED exit crypto isakmp profile BLUE match certificate CERF_MAP_BLUE exit crypto ipsec profile BLUE set isakmp-profile BLUE exit crypto ipsec profile RED set isakmp-profile RED exit But I haven't tested this solution on the routers (only at ASA).  And OU is not only 1 field that you can use at certificates. Attachment: certificates_fields.png, There is a common CA and the routers only have 1 cert each. I don't think I can have two certs from the same CA?  I think the crux of this problem is how to make the routers identify themselves uniquely depending on the tunnel interface used. It would be great if the we could use the NHRP or Tunnel key.. but that isn't part of the IKE setup.  Still Stumped, Hi, Wes Smith. I found this solution: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/ipsec-negotiation... But at this solution they tryed to use different CA servers. So my suggestion is this: can you try create 2 different trust points with the same server url but different subject-name? And enroll a certificate from each trustpoint. I wanted to test it before sending you information but I don't have spare router with me right now., Turns out you can specify a unique identity in the IKEV2 profile.  I used two different email identities. spoke@tunnel10.com and spoke@tunnel11.com. Using fqdn for identity works as well.

The key you generate there is combined with the certificate you get back from your CA. The process is documented in the User Guide here., Hi Marvin, Thanks for the feedback, The client just forked out a LARGE amount of cash on a complete new network that has 6 PKI servers in the designAre we saying this cannot be done with Microsoft certificate services- I need a certificate that their domain clients will trust?  Regards,  Pete, Pete, You only need to use openssl to generate the key and CSR. That's only since Cisco didn't build that capability into PRSM itself (beyond the self-signed certusing an auto-generated key it automatically creates using the Linux (and I would imagine openssl) under the covers that you don't have shell access to). So they force you to use openssl on some other host. Your certificate authority (CA) of choice would still issuethe certificate. That's the case whether it's a customer'sinternal Microsoft AD Certificate Services-based PKI or a public CA like Thawte,GoDaddy, Verisign, Entrust etc. If you're doing this so you can decrypt traffic for inspection, I hope you sized the boxes accordingly. You will take a big performance hit by doing that. I haven't seen benchmark numbers but have heard anecdotal storiesthat it's significant., >> If you're doing this so you can decrypt traffic for inspection, Actually no- the client has purchased aseparatesolution to do this.

Cheers Pete., No Problem- I've got the CDA to work out next (it never ends:^)) Looks like that's the same as ISE though, and my colleague has managed to do that, so fingers crossed.  P, I've not tried to change the CDA certificate. One thing I did learn just recently re CDA +PRSM- you need to specify the individual CX modules (in addition to PRSM) as registered devices in CDA.

Apparently the workaround didn't work for my version. Time to do an update!, Even with a properly issued and associatedVerisign certificate, we will still get an ""F"" until Cisco releases a fix for the POODLE TLS vulnerability that affect ASA software., Hi Marvin, do you already have an ASA with 9.3(2) running? I would be interested what the score is with and without TLS1.2 only configured. At least 9.2(3) which is quite new is still affected by POODLE.  Have a great day, Karsten, Hi Karsten- the couple of ASAs I have with 9.3(2) don't have a public-facing FQDN so I cannot run the Qualys tester against them. It's kind of ironic that this bug has come back up with TLS. All the cool kids who had already deprecated SSL were bragging about how superior TLS is when the bug was first associated only with SSL., Hello, Do you know if this has been patched yet? Thanks, J, That's interesting. I just assumed that my inability to find a Ciscoreport for POODLE TLS was just me not looking in the right place. I guess I assumed it would have been fixed by now. Inall honestly though, since I'm only running IPSEC can I close port 443 on my domain anyway? I was under the impression this was required for the certificate verification upon connection to IPSEC, but now I'm not sure. I'm too afraid to test it at the moment. I would have to try it later today. Thanks again for all of your great help with this.]",[0],1,2015-01-12,12393656,0,7,"Morning friends, I have an ASA 5512 running only an IPSEC VPN tunnel.

And DES/RC4 is broken and should be removed completely., Hi Iwen, Thanks for your help. I did all work now.

And yes, by default DH group 2 is used. But that can be configured by a parameter in the PCF-file. There are two (three) better options: Best option with very little needed configuration: Move to AnyConnect with TLS. AnyConnect is the actual Cisco client that is also supported with Windows 8.x. The legacy IPsec client isn't. Best option with a little stronger crypto but more configuration: Move to AnyConnect with IPsec/IKEv2. Move to a third-party client like shrew.net. I didn't use that client since a couple of years any more, but it's quite flexible and also has a config for a better DH-group.

service-policy global_policy global Attachment: asa2.txt asa1.txt, Why there is a nat for thegroup object network Lan_Outsid? Could you remove it?, that NAT statement for lan_outside its to allow my local network to get internet access its translated to dynamic pat., Could you delete the object nat and do it globally with the command: nat (inside,outside) after-auto source dynamic Lan_Outside interface It's just a question of NET order. With after-auto keyword, these NATs are the last executed. Thanks., Also with a full logging and/or packet capture we will be able to some traces and see what's going on. Did you took a look on the monitoring tool from asdm to view what's going on?, Thank you so much for your help. It works now. Apparently the problem is the third party firewall. When i disable the third party firewall on my computer icmp works both ways., Nice to hear that. You're very welcome, For IKEv2 configuration: (It's example config, you can change encryption, group,...)- you need to add the nat exemption statement (see my previous answer).- define your encryption domain acl: access-list IPSEC-TRAFFICextended permit ip LOCAL-LANREMOTE-LAN- Define Phase 1: crypto ikev2 enable outside crypto ikev2 policy 10 encryption 3des integrity sha md5 group 5 prf sha lifetime seconds 86400- Define Phase 2: crypto ipsec ikev2 ipsec-proposal IKEV2-PROPOSAL protocol esp encryption aes protocol esp integrity sha-1- set the tunnel group tunnel-group REMOTE-PUBLIC-IP type ipsec-l2l tunnel-group REMOTE-PUBLIC-IP ipsec-attributes ikev2 remote-authentication pre-shared-keycisco123 ikev2 local-authentication pre-shared-keycisco123- Define the crypto map crypto map CRYPTOMAP 10 match address IPSEC-TRAFFIC crypto map CRYPTOMAP 10 set peer REMOTE-PUBLIC-IP crypto map CRYPTOMAP 10 set ikev2 ipsec-proposal IKEV2-PROPOSAL crypto map CRYPTOMAP interface outside crypto isakmp identity address On your config, you have all those commands but on your VPN config, you are mixing ikev1 and ikev2.

It's very simple to set ise as intermediate ca. ISE will use SCEP protocol to distribute certificate. Look paragraphISE CA Issues Certificates to ASA VPN User. In few words, After importing root ca and when you activate ise as ca server, You will generate a csr from ISE. generate on windows the intermediate certificate for ISE based on this csr. While generated bound this certificate to the csr in ISE. That's it. Don't worry, the steps are described quite well in ISE. There is a great video, I always recommend to beginner, from labminutes; who are doing a great job: http://www.labminutes.com/sec0187_ise_13_internal_certificate_authority_... What you need to know is that you'll not be able to create specific template on ISE like you were doing on Windows.

David Castro,, Hi David, Thanks very much for replying to my post. The thing is I have got few mobile users who are working remotely and sometime they need to connect to our head office remotely and for them I need to setup a VPN. And I have got TP link router(TL-MR3420) and this router doesn't have enough option for configuring the VPN, It just have enable and disable options for IPSEC, PPTP and L2TP. I don't want to form a site-site VPN.. I just need VPN for my mobile users that's it. Should I replace the router..or is there anything that I can do with this type of router. Any advice or suggestions would be really appreciable. Thanks, Mohammed, In general, you can use either IPsec, PPTP, or L2TP for VPN client connections. However, I'm not sure if this is something which would be supported by TP-link. If you find that this isn't an option on that device, either a Cisco ASA or ISR would be able to act a remote access VPN client headend. HTH, Frank, Dear David & Frank, Thanks very much for your efforts...really appreciate that. What I have thought is taking an UBUNTU server and configuring PPTPD on that. And then later on opening the ports or doing port forwarding (1723 and 47) on the TP-LINK router. Will this be going to work or do I have to go with the cisco ASA or ISR and if you think this is the best option then according to you what series or model of ASA or ISR would you recommend for this to work. Also one more thing, I have a 4G dongle which is providing me a internet connection and that's attached to the TP LINK router and the IP address keeps changing for that dongle every then and now Please let me know what you people can suggest or advice me. Thanks, I have attached the screenshot, which shows the only option available for enabling or disabling the VPN. Attachment: 20160609_194309.jpg, Hello Mohammed, It is a pleasure, and certainly you can use the TP-LINK as the passthrough device since it is more a Router than a Firewall, and the configuration on ubuntu:- https://www.vultr.com/docs/setup-a-pptp-vpn-server-on-ubuntu Now I would recommend to buy an ISR or ASA and configure the latest client which is more secure and have a great bundle of features (AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client), or even use L2TP config, Keep me posted, please proceed to rate all of the valuable answers and mark as correct the helpful post! Regards, David Castro,, Hello Mohammed, Actually you may configure L2TP in the TP-LINK router, though if the model that you have does not prompt the option to have it configure, a small business ASA or ISR as Frank said would do the trick for L2TP, SSL or IPSec RA connectivity, you may find the steps for TP-LINK here:- http://www.tp-link.com/en/faq-444.html Keep me posted, please proceed to rate and mark as correct the helpful post!

Thanks Mohammed Rashid, Hello Mohammed, It is a pleasure, well I recommend you to purchase a 5506 which is a NG Firewall and you can configure VPN for Remote access (AnyConnect), also in a future deploy FirePOWER services(NGIPS), now getting back to it, the 5506 is a high performance firewall and can be accommodated to your environment easily, on this case for Remote access you will need to purchase additional license for the VPN users, or a router 800 series for small office:- http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/800-series-routers/index.html- http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/asa-5506-x-firepower-servi... Or you can buy the wRVS4400Nwireless-N gigabit secuirty router, which is not a bad option and supports VPN, now it also depends what you want to integrate and how it should work, but the 3 options are good, I would rather going for the ASA 5506X, though you can analyze both options, Keep me posted, please proceed to rate all of the valuable answers and mark as correct the helpful post! Regards, David Castro,, Hi David, That's very nice of you...one more thing... will I be able to generate the self signed certificates on 5506 in case if I need any, also can I install certificates on the device. Thanks Mohammed Rashid, Hello Mohammed, Indeed you can create Self Signed certs on the ASA, since the ASA has a default crypto key created, it automatically creates a Self Signed cert, and you can also create another self signed cert and have it installed in the outside, quick steps: 1. Prepare your ASA: conf t hostname myasa domain-name cisco.com clock set 00:00:00 1 Jan 2010 clock set timezone EST-5 2. Get to creating the certificate (It creates a CSR and it creates the Cert itself): crypto key generate rsa label sslvpnkeypair modulus2048 crypto ca trustpoint self  enroll self  fqdn myasa.cisco.com -- This can be the IP address or FQDN  subject-name CN=myasa.cisco.com  keypair sslvpnkeypair crypto ca enroll self noconfirm 3. Apply the new certificate: ssl trust-point self outside -- This is the way to apply it the one you created, otherwise it will use the default Self Signed cert 4.

Currently my organization wants me to set this scenario upon wireless router which should have a USB port for the 3G/4G DONGLE, they don't want to go with any other internet option right now, which they think is not feasible according to them. Now they want me to setup a wireless router with 3g/4g dongle and the router should have at least below mentioned VPN option to configure. PPTP L2TP / IPSEC RSA L2TP / IPSEC PSK IPSEC XAUTH PSK IPSEC XAUTH RSA IPSEC HYBRID RSA.

Regards, Terence, Thanks, I have a question regarding identity certificates. My client will be providing the identity certificates so I have to import them using the ""Import the identity certificate from a file"" radio button ""in manage identity certificates"". does this also import the CA certificate and the public key and does this also configure the keys on the ASA? I have searched for a demonstration but I couldn't find any Thanks, You have to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) first. Use the button ""Enroll ASA SSL with Entrust"". You can disregard the Entrust bit- the button will create a standard CSR that can be enrolled with any CA. When you do that. it will prompt you to either use an existing key on the ASA or create a new one. You should make sure you use a key of 2048-bit length (or greater). Create one if the existing available key is any smaller than 2048 bits. You then provide the CSR (file or text) to the client and they enroll it with their CA. Once they give you the certificate, you install it. Since you have created the CSR earlier, it will show in ASDM as ""pending"" under the certificate expiry date and the ""Issued to"" name will be in parentheses.

I'm a little confused as to why the ikev2 policy would be global, though? I know I could configure a global ikev2 policy on the ASA, but can't I also just configure a specific Connection Profile to use ikev2 without it affecting the Connection Profiles that are currently using ikev1? Let's say I have three Connection profiles all using ikev1, but I want to change my 123.123.123.456 Connection Profile to ikev2: 123.123.123.456- ikev2 789.489.789.123- ikev1 456.789.123.123- ikev1 If I have created a separate Group Policy and Crypto Map that only the 123.123.123.456 Connection Profile is going to use, and configure that Connection Profile to use ikev2, then won't the other two Connection Profiles still be allowed to use ikev1 even though they are all sending packets out of the same interface?, Hello, You can create specific IKEv2 policies (not global), and also have your IKEv1 policies defined at the same time, where you specify that One peer is going to use IKEv1 or IKEv2 from the other is on the (Connection profiles) known as tunnel group, Now remember that If you have just one Outside interface, You can only apply one crypto map per interface, so use the same crypto map that you use for IKEv1 peers, the only difference is that the IPSec proposal will be IKEv2, Keep me posted! Please proceed to rate and mark as correct the helpful post! David Castro,, Thanks, David. So if I have a Crypto Map applied to my outside interface that has an IPSec Proposal of ikev1 can Isimply add an ikev2 proposal to that Crypto Map as well?Willmy tunnel groups that are using ikev1 continue to do so along with my tunnel group that is now using ikev2? Right now I have three different tunnel groups, with three different peer addresses. All three of them are using a DIFFERENT crypto map on the SAME outside interface, and even though all the crypto maps are using ikev1, they are using different ikev1 transform sets. Technically, they are all using ESP-AES256-SHA but the123.123.123.456 tunnel group is using additional hashes: 123.123.123.456- ikev1- ESP-AES256-SHA, ESP-AES-192-SHA, ESP-3DES-SHA 789.489.789.123- ikev1- ESP-AES256-SHA 456.789.123.123- ikev1- ESP-AES256-SHA So can I add an ikev2 proposal with aAES256-SHA512 hash to my123.123.123.456 tunnel group and continue to have ALL three tunnel groups still pass traffic? What if I add the ikev2 proposal, but REMOVE the ikev1 proposal from that tunnel group because I don't want that tunnel group to use any hash other thanAES256-SHA512?: 123.123.123.456- ikev2- AES256-SHA512 789.489.789.123- ikev1- ESP-AES256-SHA 456.789.123.123- ikev1- ESP-AES256-SHA Do you see what I mean? All three tunnel groups on that outside interface will be using different crypto maps, with only two out of the three using ikev1 as an IPSec proposal. Will that work? Your last answer seems to imply that it wouldn't, that I would need to have ALL three tunnel groups configured for ikev1 that are using the same interface, but that I could additionally add an ikev2 IPSec proposal to the123.123.123.456 tunnel group. Also, what about the group policyDfltGrpPolicy? Currently all my tunnel groups use it but it is only configured for ikev1. I'm not really sure what it's role is in all this so can I simply add ikev2 to it?, Hello, Let me go through your questions to double clarify this: 1. if I have a Crypto Map applied to my outside interface that has an IPSec Proposal of ikev1 can Isimply add an ikev2 proposal to that Crypto Map as well? If you have a crypto map applied to your outside and 3 different peers with different sequence number, you will have to replace the IKEv1 proposal for IKEv2 for the peer that will use IKEv2, the other ones should keep using their IKEv1 IPSec proposal. 2.So can I add an ikev2 proposal with aAES256-SHA512 hash to my123.123.123.456 tunnel group and continue to have ALL three tunnel groups still pass traffic? What if I add the ikev2 proposal, but REMOVE the ikev1 proposal from that tunnel group because I don't want that tunnel group to use any hash other thanAES256-SHA512? 123.123.123.456- ikev2- AES256-SHA512 Let me expand this a little bit, If the peer 123.123.123.456, should use IKEv2, you will need to declare the IKEv2 in the tunnel group and add the pertinent ""Local and Remote PSK""--> This is for phase 1, and this means that it will use the IKEv2 policy defined before, and the IKEv2 IPSec proposal is on phase 2 where the crypto map is, you will need to replace the IKEv1 and use the IKEv2 IPSec proposal. This way it will use for phase 1 the IKEv2 policy you defined, and the Transform set IKEv2, when doing this change make sure both sides are mirrored with IKEv2 policy and IPSec proposals, and the tunnel will go down and will come up with the new proposals. This wont affect any other tunnel, as long as you change the settings to the correct tunnel group and don't delete any proposals, just remove them from the connection profile, those might be in used. 3. Do you see what I mean? All three tunnel groups on that outside interface will be using different crypto maps, with only two out of the three using ikev1 as an IPSec proposal. Will that work? You can only have one crypto map applied per interface, and the 3 tunnels using different sequence number with the same crypto map name, You can 2 tunnels on the same crypto map using IKEV1,  and still in the same crypto map have the third tunnel using IKEv2(different Transform set using IKEv2). This wont cause any issues. 4. what about the group policyDfltGrpPolicy? Currently all my tunnel groups use it but it is only configured for ikev1. I'm not really sure what it's role is in all this so can I simply add ikev2 to it? The default group policy is added by default to all of your tunnel groups(Connection Profiles), every single time you create one, the default group policy isinheritto it by default, you can change it for a Group Policy that you can create, a Group policy is a set of attributes that will be used to define something or limit it, for example for a site to site you may configure a VPN filter (It filters the traffic that goes through the tunnel), Now getting back on your point, You need to define on the default group policy the protocols that will be negotiated whether for a L2L on IKEv1 or IKEv2, Anyconnect using SSL or IKEv2 and so on, so it is important that you add the IKEv2 so the negotiation will be allowed, or either to create a new group policy and add the IKEv2 protocol; and under the tunnel group add the pertinent group policy you just created. I hope it is clarified, keep me posted! Please proceed to rate and mark as correct this post and the previous one it it helped you! David Castro,, Thanks for all the help, David. The information you provided helped to clarify some things for me. I have made the changes to the tunnel and it is up and passing traffic.

523,523,bijbalaktn,"[user1, asker, user1]","[bijbalaktn, When you say ""network refresh,"" what does that entail? We will still be using MPLS as our transport network? Either GETVPN or DMVPN will be an appropriate solution over an MPLS network. Two benefits of GETVPN includeslightly less encapsulation overhead (as it is just ESP encapsulation without GRE) and the lack of requirement for an overlay routing protocol. That said, when comparing DMVPN and GETVPN, most people are much more comfortable with DMVPN which is a benefit in and of itself. Additionally, if you are considering an IWAN solution then DMVPN is a requirement per the IWAN CVD. In short, either solution should work and it's really up to you; personally I'm a big fan of both. If you're comfortable with GETVPN and it has been working for you, it may be best to stick with that. However, DMVPN should work fine for you as well.

528,528,oliverlag,"[user1, asker, user1]","[The ISR is the only solution that really ticks all of those boxes, such as a 2900 or 3900. It is a poor cousin when it comes to SSL VPN support (it always gets new features quite a bit after the ASA). Also note none of the newer IOS-XE routers have SSL VPN support anymore. So if you go down this deployment path note that you wont be able to upgrade to a newer platform and keep the same functionality. You will end up with a better solution if you can use more than one device. Use an ISR router for everything except SSL VPN, and an ASA only for SSL VPN. Note that you may not need to use the ASA in multi-tenant mode, as you can lock incoming users to specific VLANs, and they can only talk on those VLANs. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa91/asdm71/vpn/asdm_71_vpn_config/vpn_asdm_setup.html Restrict Access to VLANâ(Optional) Also called ""VLAN mapping,"" this parameter specifies the egress VLAN interface for sessions to which this group policy applies. The ASA forwards all traffic from this group to the selected VLAN. Use this attribute to assign a VLAN to the group policy to simplify access control. Assigning a value to this attribute is an alternative to using ACLs to filter traffic on a session. In addition to the default value (Unrestricted), the drop-down list shows only the VLANs that are configured on this ASA., Hey Philip, thanks a lot for your reply. Actually I'm not able to find where the XE (1000v for example) won't support SSL anymore. At the moment it is supported, or am I wrong? http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/csr1000/release/notes/csr10... Thanks, The 4000 series and the ASR series running IOS-XE don't have SSL VPN support- but it looks like it has now been added to the CSR-1000V. I wonder if it will also come to the ""hardware"" platforms. So perhaps a single IOS-XE box can do what you want.

Can you please share more details about ' anyconnect-essentials' command? CF, The initial configuration you posted has the command ""anyconnect-essentials"". The purpose of that command is to enable only the client-based AnyConnect remote access VPN. It disables the clientless sort that is licensed with the AnyConnect Premium (old name) or Apex (new name) license type. Either method still provides a ""home page"" to login to the VPN. Thus they generally require ""webvpn"". (There is a method to use AnyConnect without SSL and instead use IKEv2 exclusively but we will not discuss that for now.) The difference is with essentials, the home page serves only to authenticate you and launches the AnyConnect client software to manage the VPN connection. With premium, you have the option of also using the clientless VPN wherein there are resources (links to internal web pages, ability to browse file systems, launch RDP sessions on the remote network etc.) presented within the browser window once you've been authenticated., Hi Rhodes, When I check the sessions connected, I see connections are showing as clientless: vpn# sh run webvpn webvpn enable outside enable inside anyconnect-essentials vpn# sh vpn-sessiondb svc Session Type: SVC Username: xIndex: 2082 Assigned IP: x.x.x.x Public IP: x.x.x.x Protocol: Clientless SSL-Tunnel DTLS-Tunnel License: SSL VPN Encryption: AES256 Hashing: SHA1 Bytes Tx: 197476233 Bytes Rx: 26429696 This is confusing!

539,539,colin-higgins,"[user1, user2, user3, user2, user3]","[Hi Colin, What was the previous ASA versionyou were using? On newer ASA codes post 8.2 there is no concept of NAT control. So it should work. You can use a packet tracer to confirm if it is taking a NAT statement or not. Regards, Aditya Please rate helpful posts and mark correct answers., Previous code version was 9.1-I then upgraded to the current. The documentation I have seen seem to suggest we need NAT exemptions as before, but this is working without any issues, so I am wondering if the new code is intelligent enough to know that traffic going to the VPN pool should not be translated., Hello Colin, If you dont set up the NAT exemption statements, and run a packet tracer on the ASA from internal IPs to the AnyConnect are those hitting any object NAT, or static NAT?, could you please attach the config or the specific config on this and the packet tracer?, Now most of the traffic should come from the AnyConnect users so those should be hitting either the NONAT or any other NAT statement, if dont it simply goes to the destination without the necessity of a NAT statement, as Aditya said NAT control is not used anymore, but please elaborate a little bit more so we can better understand your deployment, so far I have used the same code and it needs a NAT exemption only when the sources are translated when going out, Please proceed to rate and mark as correct the helpful post! David Castro,, David: I tested this by adding a new internal host to the VPN access list and then connecting to it from a Anyconnect VPN session. Looks like the ASA doesn't need the NAT exemption, and instead says ""per-session"" in the NAT phase. So an example below is from the internal host 10.101.8.251 to a client IP in the VPN pool 192.168.110.10 Phase: 1 Type: ROUTE-LOOKUP Subtype: Resolve Egress Interface Result: ALLOW Config: Additional Information: found next-hop &lt;Internet Router IP> using egress ifc outside  Phase: 2 Type: NAT Subtype: per-session Result: ALLOW Config: Additional Information:  Phase: 3 Type: IP-OPTIONS Subtype: Result: ALLOW Config: Additional Information:  Phase: 4 Type: IDS Subtype: Result: ALLOW Config: class-map ips_class match access-list ips_traffic policy-map global_policy class ips_class  ips inline fail-open service-policy global_policy global Additional Information:  Phase: 5 Type: NAT Subtype: per-session Result: ALLOW Config: Additional Information:  Phase: 6 Type: IP-OPTIONS Subtype: Result: ALLOW Config: Additional Information:  Phase: 7 Type: FLOW-CREATION Subtype: Result: ALLOW Config: Additional Information: New flow created with id 28270972, packet dispatched to next module  Result: output-interface: outside output-status: up output-line-status: up Action: allow If I connect to a host that does have a NAT exemption configured, I do see the exemption referenced, and it still works. My code level is 9.6, so I am wondering if Cisco removed the need for the exemption., Hi Colin, Well usually a NAT exemption is required, on 9.X code introduces the the per-session PAT and multi-session PAT feature, the Per-session feature is enabled by default and is allowed for a better scalability this feature also does not have a Timeout what this means is that you can have more conns (PAT translations over one IP address) than multi-session, now getting back to the initial query, letÂ´s remember that a dynamic NAT is not bidirectional, so you are coming from the VPN client directly to the client IP, and it is allowed. The question is (is there an object NAT configured for internet that should be matched?), at which line # is the NAT exemption at? what happens if you delete the NAT exemption, or place it as line 1? Because you are clarifying that the NAT exemption is still being matched, so it seems that somehow is required, though if you see it from the perspective that the dynamic NAT is unidirectional for inside hosts, and the existing flow seems to be: VPN user goes to the ASA and it is allowed since it is a VPN traffic and the ""Sysopt connection permit-vpn"" allows the traffic and then there is not NAT matched (right here it should matched the NAT exempt, if it doesn't, it is not matching any other NAT for the ""outside host"") then the traffic just keeps going to the internal host (Session Management Path), afterwards the response should match this flow through the (Fast Path flow), obviously the packet is the encapsulated and encrypted and the other way around as well. Keep me posted! Please proceed to rate and mark as correct the helpful post!

545,545,cnaferdie,[user1],"[@F Martinez, I hope you're well and thank you for the post. The difference is as per the below explanations. Full-Tunnel Architecture: ALL traffic from the client will traverse the tunnel. So the internet breakout for the traffic on the client side will actually occur at the router, as opposed to from the clients own internet connection. Split-Tunnel Architecture: Only selected traffic from the client side will traverse the tunnel. So internet breakout and anything else will leave straight from the client and never traverse the tunnel. Google may also answer your questions if I haven't answered this well enough. HTH.

When you create the VPN in Amazon they email you a suggested configuration for your device. In your case, it would use Tunnel interfaces. You really should use whatthey recommend. I don't think you'll be able to configure this in the GUI. And in short you can not use two crypto maps with the exact same encryption domains to two different destinations. What you could do is specify the second VPN peer as a backup. Something like: no crypto map SDM_CMAP_1 2 ipsec-isakmp crypto map SDM_CMAP_1 1 ipsec-isakmp description Tunnel 1 to 52.35.42.787 set peer 52.35.42.787 set peer 52.36.15.787 set transform-set AWS-VPN set pfs group2 match address 100, Hi Philip, I did as you recommended and added my second peer as a backup... but it will still not bring up my second tunnel on Amazon up simultaneously, I guess this is only possible with virtual Tunnel interfaces correct? if yes, would you have a quick instructions how I can set this up, I have not configured IPsec over virtual tunnels before. Thanks and appreciate your help., There should be no second tunnel. I uses either one peer or the other, but not both at the same time.

UDP/4500 is "" non500-isakmp"" and ESP will always be encapsulated in UDP., Thanks! I was wondering of putting ""inspect"" there but I read somewhere that according to vpn traffic the difference between ""inspect"" and ""pass"" matters. "" inspect: used to detect connection requests and provide the appropriate openings for return traffic. (Similar to what is achieved with the ip inspect command withina CBAC environment). pass: this unidirectional action is equivalent to a permit statementinside an ACL and is not capableofhandlingreturn traffic. The pass action fits well for dealing with statelessflows such astraffic encrypted with Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol."" And the last thing: What about the statement ""permit ip any host 192.168.5.253"" Does it mean ""permit all ip addresses from outside to vpn_server with ip 192.168.5.253, along with all tcp and udp ports? If so, I guess it's potentially unsafe to place it in the acl. Regards,, After the client connects to the VPN, you want return traffic to flow back to the client. That can be easily allowed with ""inspect"". And from the standpoint of the firewall, you don't have ESP-traffic (which would be IP/50). You only have UDP-traffic (initially UDP/500 which switches to UDP/4500) And you are right with your last ACE. That one is much to permissive and not needed for this function., thank you Karsten Iwen for help. I'll put config on my router and write here if it works.

555,555,szejiekoh,"[user1, user2, user3, user1, user3, user1, user3, user1, user1, user3, user1, user3, user1]","[Anyone?:(, In general, one default route like ' ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 tunnel1 (ipsec tunnel) ' will be installed on remote ipsec client. The mentioned route ' 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.254' will be recursive lookup until it hit the default route. So the tunneled packet will be sent over the IPsec tunnel. when the packet arrived at IPsec gateway, the outer IP header will be removed and IP route lookup will serve only for the inner IP packet. it is reasonable that ASA know how to reach 192.168.4.0 by its IGP routing. For site to site IPsec deployment, after ipsec tunnel (not using crypto-map, using tunnel protection mode) was setup, then setup IGP neighbor between IPsec peer, advertise site specific route to each other, the ipsec tunnel can be seen as logical link, packet forwarding was no difference with other physical link., The routes installed on your host when connected to the remote access VPN are determined by the VPN Server configuration. It may be certain subnets or hosts (this setup is called ""split tunnel"" as the traffic is split between that which is tunneled and everything else) or it may be all routes (no split tunnel) For the remote addresses that need to use VPN, it will install routes saying to use the public IP of the ""VPN Server"". It will encrypt / encapsulate the traffic in SSL or IPsec (two most common methods) and send it on to the VPN server which knows to unencrypt / decapsulate it. The gateway(s) the VPN server uses on the remote network are not apparent to your client PC. The VPN server has its own routes which may be defined statically or it may participate in an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) like EIGRP or OSPF. You don't need a dedicated subnet for your VPN client addresses, just unique addresses that the remote systems know how to reach (e.g. via the VPN server)., Hi Marvin, So sorry for the late reply and a million appreciation and thanks for the straight to the point explanation. I hope you are still around... Would you mind to clarify abit further on the below For the remote addresses that need to use VPN, it will install routes saying to use the public IP of the ""VPN Server"" q1) to use the public IP of ""VPN Server"" as the? (is the answer ""gateway"")? q2) i would believe routes that need to be encrypted/routed, will use the tunnel interface (on the vpn client/host) as the exit interface, and that tunnel interface will encapsulate and send traffic to the VPN server)-- right? q3) However, the point of confusion is that when traffic reach the VPN server which decapsulate the packet and realize that the packet wasn't meant for itself, surely it would need some sort of routing / forwarding capability right?-- thus can i say VPN server (must somehow do ""routing"" as well)? q4) and here come the last bit, from what i know, traffic to different destination network from source are routed. is it possible for the scenario below vpn client (host)'s vpn/tunnel interface ip -> 192.168.0.10 vpn client public ip-> 202.202.202.3 vpn server internal ip-> 192.168.0.11 vpn server public ip-> 63.63.63.4 vpn server side 's gateway-> 192.168.0.254 (a l3 switch to reach other network) and the vpn client has a route to 192.168.40.0/24 network via the VPN server and send a ping to 192.168.40.1 Since the VPN client (192.168.0.10) is in the same subnet as the remote gateway (192.168.0.254)- Is traffic still send to the VPN server (192.168.0.11)? If yes, does that means the VPN server upon receiving and decapsulate the packet, realize that the destination is meant for a.40/24 network, will then route the packet to the gateway in the same subnet (192.168.0.254)? q5) if the answer to the above is a yes, does that means the VPN server is still consider as a hop, even though the vpn client, vpn server, l3 gateway are all in the same subnet (is it possible for the vpn client, vpn server and the actual gateway behind the vpn server to be all in the same subnet)? and in the vpn client (host side)'s tunnel interface, there will not be a gateway entry for 192.168.0.254? Regards, Noob, Yes when VPN is established a tunnel interface becomes activated. All remote networks defined by VPN server configuration which are configured on client upon connection use that tunnel interface. When the VPN server receives and decapsulate the packets, it routes them to the destination based on its internal routing logic, as defined in either static or dynamic routes. The VPN server does not appear as a ""hop"" as the traffic was enacapsulated in the SSL or IPsec wrapper from the client to VPN server. The decapsulated packet appears to come from the client address in the VPN address pool. The remote VPN client does not ever know about the VPN server's routing logic to remote internal networks. That is one of the functions of the VPN server., Hi Marvin, Thanks for the marvellous reply and a Happy mayday to you. q1) on the host/vpn client side, there is a tunnel interface whom ip address is allocated via/from the VPN address pool- am i right? is/will there be a similar tunnel interface created on the VPN server side? q2) can the allocated ip on the vpn client, and the vpn server, and the remote gateway (l3 switch) be in the same subnet? The intention that i want was to give my vpn client the same subnet range as all my other workstations in the office user network. (192.168.0.0/24)- and the VPN server is also inside this subnet. i am wondering if the above is workable/true; when i use my vpn client to ping to another actual workstation in the office network (which is in the same 192.168.0.0/24) subnet; does it means that the packet will stlil go the VPN server to be decapsulated-> but what will happen when the VPN server realize that the packet is destined to a workstation in the same subnet as VPN server itself? will it still be able to forward/send out via its connected interface to the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet to the actual destined workstation? Regards, Noob, Answer to q1: That's correct on the client side. On the VPN server side, not exactly. The hosts it assigns from the VPN pool appear to be on the VPN server. It will respond to any internal hosts wanting to send traffic to the VPN client addresses. Answer to q2: Yes they can all be on the same subnet although that may be a bit confusing to anyone who doesn't know the setup since it won't be apparent that a given client isn't actually local. The VPN server will know to decapsulate since the traffic is part of a security association whose rules are checked for this reason (among others)., Hi Marvin, Thanks and greatly appreciate your reply. On answer1) Do you mean there will be something like a session table.. any traffic/packets to those client's IPs allocated via the VPN pool will be encapsulated and resend out to the VPN client..- right? On answer 2) On having the client (ip from vpn pool), vpn server and the remote L3 gateway on the same subnet-> does that means that If there is a workstation (192.168.0.20) on the actual site connected to the same switch/same subnet as the VPN server (192.168.0.0/24) network Dong a ping from a VPN client (tunnel interface 192.168.0.10)- will result in the following path-> vpn client-> vpn server-> workstation The vpn client will send to the vpn server, the vpn server will decapsulate the packet; and see that it is destined to its connected network (192.168.0.0/24), and still forward the packet out to the workstation (192.168.0.20)- right? Regards, Noob, Hi Marvin, Still there?:) Regards, Noob, Yes.Participation in this forum is a volunteer activity and often the day job will preempt quick replies. There is ""something like "" a session table. Actually a set of IPsec security Associations (SAs) that the VPN appliance uses to keep track of the connected remote clients. It represents to the local network(s) that those clients are on the appliance itself (even though they are actually remote) so the traffic to/from VPN clients and the local subnet(s) will never see the VPN appliance itself as being in the path (e.g., via traceroute output), Hi Marvin, So sorry if i seems to be rushing you for a reply. Greatly appreciate you taking time to reply my questions and a millions thanks. Last, sorry to iterate, but i just want to confirm the idea that when the vpn client (tunnel ip), vpn server and destination workstation are all in the same internal subnet, the vpn upon decapsulating the network packet- will still send the packet out of its connected interface to that subnet and to the workstation- right?

Could you verify the permitted ACL on SonicWall, are we matching it? Regards, Aditya Please rate helpful posts., Hi Aditya, Thank you so much for the quick response. The TCP is because ultimately this is going to be for SQL replication to an offsite server, so TCP 1433 will be used (I just threw ip in there as that is what we had on a very similar setup on the same router). Looking at it now I think I should have allowed ICMP if anything, just for testing at least. On the Sonicwall end they are currently allowing all traffic through, but they specifically stated that they weren't seeing anything come through at all when I tried to ping. Most of the errors we've been able to see on either side come from when they send traffic through.  I agree it seems something with flagging the interesting traffic, but that's where I'm pretty stuck.I don't have a line specifically allowing ICMP traffic, but I don't have that in either of my working configs either. I did remove my Nat0 statement from my PIX and am now seeming to get ""interesting traffic"", at least some sort of response from the router.

It shows this every time I try: User not authorized for AnyConnect Client access, contact your administrator. I'm using ASA 9.4(1) and ASDM 7.4(1).I tried debugging the crap out of this and checking logs, but everything seems to be working as it should.

564,564,cdkading1,"[user1, asker, user2, asker, user2, asker, user2, user1]","[Hi There, It's certainly fine to use public IP's in the encryption domains Are you saying that you want to NAT all private IP's/Networks behind your firewall to appear as the single public IP when talking over the VPN to the remote IPs? You could achieve this with something like this... There should be no reason for downtime when setting up a site to site VPN Hopefully I am not missing the point here- is it the NAT configuration that you are not sure about? I am not too sure what you mean by this point.. "" All Http Https traffic must originate 97.X.X.22"" but then you say... ""Our local encryption domain must be a public IP: 174.X.X.194/32 "" So, how do you want the traffic to source? Here is an example of how the NAT may look for this. Using object groups makes it easier and neater: object-group network LOCAL-REAL network-object X.X.X.X 255.255.255.0 network-object host Y.Y.Y.Y object-group network LOCAL-PUBLIC network-object host 174.X.X.194 object-group network REMOTE network-object 207.X.X.0 255.255.255.0   network-object host144.X.X.90  network-object host144.X.X.91  network-object host144.X.X.22  network-object host144.X.X.25  nat (any,outside) source static LOCAL-REAL LOCAL-PUBLIC destination static REMOTE REMOTE no-proxy-arp route-lookup, Current Config is like below. So all local traffic when talking over the VPN (peer ip) 97.X.X.22 should have the source ip of LOCAL-PUBLIC 174.X.X.194 for traffic on the other end. All regular network traffic web etc should originate from the outside 97.X.X.22. It looks like you hit the nail on the head with your config. Does my VPN look right or do i need to specify the LOCAL-PUBLIC in the VPN acl so that this reads.. access-list outside_cryptomap extended permit ip LOCAL-PUBLIC object-group SP access-list outside_cryptomap_1 extended permit ip LOCAL-PUBLIC object-group SP It looks like I should add: object- group network LOCAL- PUBLIC network- object host 174.X. X. 194 and: nat (any, outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 LOCAL- PUBLIC destination static SP SP no- proxy- arp route- lookup Remove this: nat (inside,outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 destination static SP SP no-proxy-arp route-lookup Is that right?

Just add the public IP to the crypto ACL as the source at your end, and have the remote end add it to their crypto ACL as the destination. Also, do the NAT configuration mentioned earlier and you should be set.-- Please remember to select a correct answer and rate helpful posts, Hey, As Marius mentions, you'll need to use the public IPs in the crypto ACL. Also quite right not to use two crypto maps for the same thing. That said, it's not necessarily a problem, becuase crypto maps are checked in the order of their numbering, from lower to higher- once there is a match it will stop. So if you have 2 the same, it will match the first one then stop. That said, it has scope to cause confusion and if it is not needed then don't use it. When I first started doing funky things with NAT, I would get a little confused about how the Crypto ACL should look. However, I come to remember it in a very easy way. The crypto ACL is used to determine what security associations will be built over a VPN tunnel. In your case, the communications are going to be via public IPs on both sides- therefore the SA on the tunnel will be between these public IPs and so, you need to use the public IPs in the crypto ACL So, referring back to the example from earlier and using the same object group names for the sake of being neat, it would be like this: access-list outside_cryptomap_1 extended permit ip object-group LOCAL-PUBLIC object-group REMOTE You don't need the Private IPs in there- remember NAT happens first. If you were using private IPs over the tunnel then you would use the private IPs and have a NAT exemption rule, which it seems you had earlier but is not required in this case. I am referring to this line you mentioned earlie that is not needed in this scenario- this is a NAT exemption and ensures that the private IPs remain private (this is also known as Identity NAT), whereas in your case you want it to change to public nat (inside,outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.1.0_24 destination static SP SP no-proxy-arp route-lookup]","[2, 7]",1,2016-04-21,12985486,0,8,I have a question that has been answered in some variations throughout the forum and I feel my Newbie status will be clear.

CF?, ""Other VPN Peers"" is site to site VPNs. 2 users can connect using either AnyConnect or the clientless web interface. Either way, a combined two people at once. If you are planning on using the VPN for users you really need to buy the AnyConnect VPN licences., I got it. If I buy a 25 user anyconnect plus license, can I install it in 2 ASAs but still limited to 25 user count together., If you buy a single 25 user licence you can only install it on a single ASA. If you have a failover ASA pair, you can install the licence on one of them, and then whichever is the active firewall gets the 25 licences., Philip the AnyConnect 4.x licenses are NOT limited to a single ASA (or HA pair). This is a change from 3.x and earlier versions. You can redeem the PAKs for as many ASAs as are used for remote access VPN within a given customer. As long as you don't exceed the number of licensed users you are within the terms of the license. The number of users is not currently enforced technically- it's up to the customer, as advised by their reseller, to purchase the correct licensing level., Now that is a big change. So lets say I buy a 250 user licence and I have 5 x ASA's. Do I redeem the same PAK against each of them saying I just want 50 users each? I've never had the system allow a single PAK code to be used more than once., Philip, Actually when you redeem the 4.x PAKs they will show the ASA as licensed for the maximum number of users the platform supports. It's up to the end user to manage the licensing level at this time. You do redeem the same PAK code against all of your ASAs. Each is entitled to the number of unique users (unique in the aggregate) that you are licensed for. Note the second sentence in this excerpt from the AC Ordering Guide: You cannot associate more than one Adaptive Security Appliance serial number with your PAK on a single license registration page. The same product activation key (PAK) can be applied to multiple appliances by repeating this process. Here's a screenshot of the license portal showing one AnyConnect Apex PAK redeemed on two ASAs: ac_4_pak_fulfillment.png, I learned something new today. Thank you!, So this mean, if I buy a 100 user license, I can redeem 50 for one ASA and save the remaining 50 for future purpose. But this will also need all user should install Anyconnect version 4 in their laptops. Am I right?, FYI, I just tried this today. I redeemed aL-AC-PLS-S-3Y-100 for a customer. The licencing portal said it was issuing a licence for 99998 users. The licencing email that turns up is for 500 users. This was going onto a 5516, and when installed it says: The Running Activation Key feature: 500 AnyConnect Premium sessions exceed the limit on the platform, reduced to 300 AnyConnect Premium sessions. And subsequently the firewall ends up with 300 AnyConnect Premium licences. PLEASE DO NOT DISCARD THIS EMAIL. You have received this email because your email address was provided to Cisco Systems during the registration process for a Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance activation key. Please read this email carefully and forward it with any attachments to the proper system administrator if you are not the correct person.

I plan to challenge the BU on this behavior at the upcoming SEVT next week. It's challenging for me to explain and I work with these almost every day. @Cisco Freak  If you buy a 100 user license then that means you are licensed for 100 unique users no matter how many ASAs you have or install the license on. The licensing on the ASA does not force you to use AnyConnect 4.x on the end users- the image (pkg file) that you upload and define in your profile does that. That said, AC 4.x is certainly recommended as Cisco is no longer developing AC 3.x going forward., Here is the ordering guide for AnyConnect licencing- yep- it's complicated. Best to ask a reseller for assistance. http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/security/anyconnect-og.pdf If you just want ""basic"" AnyConnect VPN access, you need a ""Plus"" licence. You need a licence for each user which can connect (rather than concurrently) and you need to choose a term for the licence.

First thing from your config though, I see you have PFS enabled- have you ensured this is set on the Fortinet side, or tried turning it off on the Cisco side to see if that comes up? Being stuck at MM_WAIT_MSG3 means that you have sent back your policies but then you have not recieved the third packet in the ISAKMP exchange so either the Fortigate is unhappy about something or there is a routing issue (though, unlikely since you have already had communication) Try on the ASA side: debug crypto isakmp 7 Also can you confrm that your outside interface is 'outside1'? You can see this from 'show ip', Hello David! Thanks for your support I saw some people on the internet with lifetime issue and I change this on ASA, but the result stil the same. PFS is enable because the other side asked me to enable, I have 18 VPN in this ASA and only this new was asked to enable PFS. I told the other side about the MM_WAIT_MSG3 and he told that in his side is everything okay, we compare all the settings and seems is the same.

So I decided to abandon setting up vpn on my 2600 router, and bought Cisco 1921 K9/SEC router, added it to my existing network, configured it, and boom everything works like a charm.

You also do not need to configure crypto isakmp identity address as it is set to auto. This command tells that the tunnel would be negotiated on the basis of IP address but since it is set to auto it will on it own do that so no need to specify this command. Yes you can create a new group policy and tunnel group for this new tunnel and it should have no impact on the other working tunnels.

Other strange thing is that on the ASA 5506 some times I create network object and this object disapear and I didnÂ´t make a reload just change the fron one tab such as ""Objects"" to ""Remote Access VPN""., Hi Marcio, This is pretty weird that the objects were deleted from the ASDM. I checked for some bugs on this code but could not find one. Regarding the VPN status we needed some debug info/logs to understand what caused this failure. Could you again create a new object and navigate to Remote VPN and check? Please share the show version of the ASA.

Also port 500 and 4500 is required to be allowed on firewall., Ok perfect, we are running iptables nat firewall so destination NAT will not be an issue... just one more question if you don't mind, I understand that CISCO1921/K9 comes with 2 interfaces, one interface should be used for my outside interface and the other for my private lan, but since I will be connecting from behind the firewall, can I accomplish this only by connectingto one interface on theCISCO1921/K9?, INTERNET--> ISP Modem----> Firewall---- CISCO1921/K9----> LAN if this is your topology then you definitely need to use both the interface of Cisco1921 and by the way which firewall you are using? why don't you create VPN on that firewall? why you are bumping a router in your network just for VPN termination?, We are using Lanner firewall (made by www.lannerinc.com), it basically runs a Linux os on it with iptables nat, I wish I could use the firewall for the site to site vpn, but because of our firewall type, its impossible at the moment, have no choice but to throw the Cisco1921 behind the firewall... im just thinking how will I need to utilize the two ports on this device sincethe router's2 ports will be on the private subnet?, Hi Paul, You can use below example LAN (10.10.10.x/24)--- Router-- WAN (192.168.1.x/30)-- Firewall-- ISP on the firewall you will static NAT for Routers WAN IP to a public IP given by your ISP.

Source NAT:- when your router will initiate VPN Before NAT:- Source 10.1.1.1---- destination (remote peer IP) After NAT:- Source 81.92.61.2---- destination (remote peer IP) Destination NAT:- when remote location will initiate VPN before NAT:- Source (remote peer IP)----- Destination (81.92.61.2) After NAT:- Source (remote peer IP)----- Destination (10.1.1.1) hope it is clear:), Hello Salman, your answer explains exactly what I was looking for, Thank You very much for the help.]",[5],1,2016-04-08,12957676,1,7,I am looking to buy CISCO1921/K9 to set up site to site vpn with Amazon VPN.

Based on your original configuration you have 2 NAT problems. The first has to do with NAT ordering. In ASA 8.3 and later code we are dealing with Twice NAT which are 2 ordered sections going before and after theObject NAT. My general rule of thumb for NAT ordering is like this: Twice NAT (Before)- Use this section for NAT exemptionsor unusual configurations that must go first Object NAT- Use this section for static NAT statements for servers Twice NAT (After)- Use this section for your global NAT statements, basically a catch all Next, never use ""any"" as an interface for any NAT statement. This may seem like a good idea, but itwill bite you. Remember, there is nolonger the concept of NAT control, so an ""any"" interface will screw up both VPN and DMZ configurations alike. Always be specific about your interface pairs for NAT. To that end, here is what I suggest that your NAT configuration should look like: nat (inside,outside) source static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.2.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.2.0_24 destination static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.4.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.4.0_24 no-proxy-arp route-lookup! object network DEVWEB-SSH nat (inside,outside) static interface service tcp ssh ssh! nat (inside,outside) after-auto source dynamic any interface nat (outside,outside) after-auto source dynamic any interface The key is that you need a NAT explicitly translating the VPN traffic. PSC, Hi Ben, You just need to create the following NAT: ASA(config)# Object network obj-192.168.4.0 ASA(config-network-object)# subnet 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 ASA(config-network-object)# nat (outside,outside) dynamic interface Regards, Aditya Please rate helpful posts and mark correct answers., Hi Aditya Many thanks for this- unfortunately it hasn't fixed the issue: Result of the command: ""sh run nat"" nat (inside,any) source static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.2.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.2.0_24 destination static NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.4.0_24 NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.4.0_24 no-proxy-arp! object network obj_any nat (any,outside) dynamic interface object network DEVWEB-SSH nat (inside,outside) static interface service tcp ssh ssh object network NETWORK_OBJ_192.168.4.0_24 nat (outside,outside) dynamic interface When connected, users can ping our internal network (192.168.2.x) and also the address of our gateway router(192.168.3.3) which isattached to the outside interface, however they can't ping/access outside of that.

Hi I've upgraded from a Cisco ASA 5505 to a 5506X, and as such have moved up to ASA 9.5 Because of this I'm a bit stuck on how to implement VPN. I've followed the wizard, and I can now establish inbound connections, but when connected (all traffic is tunnelled) there is no internet connectivity.

592,592,abdou.bekk1,"[user1, asker, user1, user2, asker, user1, user3, asker]","[When you deploy AnyConnect it's over SSL. If you don't bind the SSL certificate to the ASA's outside interface, you could instead bind it to the internal interface and launch your VPN from there. While it probably doesn't make sense VPN-wise it would suffice to deploy a client. In the production configuration however, there's no option to restrict what network the clients are coming from. Two factor is a common use case for VPN authentication. If you have a PKI that's issuing client certificates you can certainly combine that with RADIUS authentication. You can even prefill the username from the certificate and prevent end users from using anything else during the login process., Hi Marvin, Thank you very much for the quick reply. That's what i tought so but to convince my boss I had to be sure. Sincerly yours, Abdel., You're welcome. Please mark your question as answered if it has been., With an controle plane acl you can restrict networks which can connect to your interface (tunnel endpoint). So you can permit your internal network to connect with https to the interface wich is your anyconnect endpoint and deny any other You can configure this in the ASDM under: Configuration > Device Management > Management Access > Management Access Rules Hope this helps you, Hi Zierut, Thanks for answering. The management access rules I think they apply only for ASDM and ASA logins, no?. Plus, what they wanted in my company is that the first connexion to be able to Deploy AnyConnect in a device got to be from the company's network. Example: If you're on ourcompany and you want to use AnyConnect (our VPN). To be able to deploy it for the firstime on your machine you have to be on the internal network and this without deactivating the Outside interface. This is pretty complicated because on the ASA we can't shut the login portal (from where we download AnyConnect package) only on one interface and permit it on the other while the Clientless option stays activated. If we uncheck inside or outside in Options of AnyConnect or Clientless settings WE can't connect at all from the unchecked interface and if I shutdown the login portal it applies for both Inside and Outside. If I can permit the login portal only from the inside and keep the possibility to connect with AnyConnect on the outside int. once deployed on a device, it would be the appropriate solution. Sincerly yours., What's the rationale for only wanting to deploy while on the inside network? It seems like a lot of work to go through for what seems on the face of it to be a bit of an unusual requirement. No matter where a client gets the AnyConnect software, the thing that governs how it behaves and what it allows is in the profile- an XML file whose master copy is stored on the ASA. The profile is checked and (if necessary) updated every time a remote client logs into the VPN., For your use case, you can indicate to your users the trusted VPN address they need to enter in AnyConnect where you are configuring your ASA appliance, i.e.: office.mycompanyVPN.com And in the AnyConnect settings select: ""Block connections to untrusted servers"" For two factor authentication, you can use LoginTC and leverage your RADIUS authentication without the hassle of certificates. A complete guideline to enable a CISCO appliance with LoginTC can be found here: https://www.logintc.com/docs/connectors/cisco-asa.html, Hi Mark, Thanks for your reply. My company don't want to pass by a Cloud services for the Two factor authentication. I saw some solutions with the managers like DUO and LoginTC and they don't want it. Now we are talking about the authentication, what about authorizations. By that I mean permitting or revoking the access to some servers by some employees according to Active Directory Groups. Also, the manager now wants to deactivate the weblogin (web portal) on the outside interface but keep permitting AnyConnect Mobile and PC to connect.

596,596,marcio.tormente,"[user1, asker, user1, asker, user2, asker]","[HiMarco, I'm unsure if when you say member of an AD domain you mean member of a specific security group in AD. If this is the case then yes this is possible, this can be done with LDAP attribute mapping on the ASA, this can also be done with Radius mapping however this needs to be done on the server not the ASA when using Radius.You can also do something similar with certificate mapping.DAP can also be used together with it and continue to assign the attributes that you are assigning depending on what you are matching on the DAP. Here are a few links for the mapping methods I mentioned before: ASA Use of LDAP Attribute Maps Configuration Example: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-nex...

Configure ACS to Assign a Group Policy at Login using RADIUS http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-access-control... Hope this helps., Hello William, Thanks for your support The DAP that is configured is to use LDAP and the people only can authenticate if they are member of a group, this works very well. Now my customer want provide VPN only if the computer is registered on the domain controller, in other word, if the person want to use VPN in theys personal computer, will be not possible, then I need to make sure tht, when this person try to connect to the VPN is chek if they computer is registered on the AD. Thanks, Hi Marcio, I see, ok in that case what you would want is to deploy HostScan so it can scan the endpoint connecting to the ASA. this scan report will be sent to the ASA and you can create DAP policies against certain attributes that will allow the connection. Once you have applied the DAPs you want to permit then you need to set the default DAP to terminate all connections. make sure you be very specific with the permit DAPs and that your client comply with what you are matching otherwise you may have unauthorized clients connecting or users that are unable to connect. the endpoints that don't meet the criteria will get the default and terminate the connection. DAP and HostScan being so versatile it is hard to find documentation on that or specific configuration examples. I think the requirement is to run 8.4 or higher though.We can help you here at TAC with the configuration if you need assistance. Hope this helps., Thanks William, Open a TAC case I think is the best option., Hello marcio.tormente, I am going through a similar kind of configuration dead end. However, I was able to resolve the issue as far Windows users are concern. I have created a ""registry"" DAP policy pointing to the Domain Name configured in the endpoint and applied it. The tests are positive. On the Windows endpoints the registry entry can be found at: ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Domain"" Now I am looking for a similar kind of configuration for the MacOS users. Hope this helps. Thank You & Regards, Ameya Dhage, Hello Amdhage! I solve this problem with DAP as you mantion, this work fine.

610,610,latenaite2011,"[user1, asker, user1]","[Hello, This is expected due to the way the ASA's routing table is currently designed. ASA maintains not only global routing table but per-interface routing table as well. In case of IPSecVPN,ASA Control-Path will do a route look-up for the reply packet. That look-up will return the outside/primary ISP interface as the best route but since you tried connecting on backup, ASA will drop the packet. In case of Anyconnect VPN or SSH/Telnet, ASA creates a connection for forward flow and reverse flow for initial request and does not go through route look-up mechanism and just uses egress interface (where the request was received) to send the reply out. Anyconnect session will follow per-interface routing table.

611,611,lovleen.arora,[user1],"[Hi Lovleen, The feature allowing this has been introduced on the ASA as of Cisco ASA 5500 Versions 8.2(1). Please read the description found in ""Table 12 New Features for ASA Version 8.2(1)"", third row: ""Double Authentication"", it briefly explains what the feature can do, what are the configuration commands and restrictions. URL: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa82/release/notes/asarn82.html To summarize: the feature you are looking for is only available when using AnyConnect Client on a Windows platform and if RSA (2 factor authentication) is set as the primary authentication method while an additional AAA authentication method such as AD is set as secondary. The RSA/SDI authentication method cannot be set secondary. I would recommend using the latest AC v3 release. Please also find included below an example which I'm hoping will be helpful: (1) Assuming that currently the configuration only uses AD as authentication method the tunnel group configuration will look like this: tunnel-group Employees type remote-access tunnel-group Employees general-attributes authentication-server-group LDAP-AD11 default-group-policy Employees tunnel-group Employees webvpn-attributes group-url https://vpn.com/Employees enable (2) Then, once you have configured your SDI server, you need to configure it as primary authentication method and the old method as secondary. Commands: tunnel-group XXXX general-attributes secondary-authentication-server-group ""Server Name"" Note: Native RSA/SDI is not supported as the secondary authentication server. It must be configured as the primary authentication aaa-server SdiServers protocol sdi aaa-server SdiServers host 1.1.1.1 SharedSecret aaa-server SdiServers host 1.1.1.2 SharedSecret Example: tunnel-group Employees general-attributes authentication-server-group SdiServers &lt;--- RSA/SDI secondary-authentication-server-group LDAP-AD11 &lt;--- LDAP Let me know if this helps.

614,614,rfranzke,"[user1, asker, user1, user1]","[I think you need a completely different approach- DAP (Dynamic Access Policies). DAP allows you to query lots of things, and you can create additive policies. So if you are a member of group ""A"" you append this URL. If you are also a member of group ""B"" you append this ACL. If it can also do other things, like check registry keys, etc. Check out the DAP deployment guide. https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/7691/asa-8x-dynamic-access-policies-dap-deployment-guide I pretty much only use DAP now(and not attribute maps) because of the huge increase in flexibility., Thanks for the reply here.Yes agreed that DAP is most likely a better way to go with this. I was under the impression that DAP required an Advanced Endpoint Assessment license to function which I did not have when I originally set this up so I used attribute maps. I have never been sure if that means that you can use DAP for auth parameters (AD group membership for example) and not configure policies that require endpoint assessment (presence of registry keys, etc.), or if that means any DAP configured on here would not work. I just went with attribute maps and moved on. I had to get a different VPN license to enable higher end SSL encryption (TLS 2.0) recently. When I looked at the license today it seems I now have both endpoint assessment and Anyconnect premium enabled now as a result: AnyConnect Premium Peers: 250 perpetual AnyConnect Essentials: 250 perpetual Other VPN Peers: 250 perpetual Total VPN Peers: 250 perpetual Shared License: Disabled perpetual AnyConnect for Mobile: Enabled perpetual AnyConnect for Cisco VPN Phone: Enabled perpetual Advanced Endpoint Assessment: Enabled perpetual So I should be OK now to use DAP. In looking at the options for DAP for GP assignment, it still seems to only support AD group membership as a way to assign ASA VPN Group Policies (Attribute ID: memberOf). Again to use this I would still need to create multiple AD groups, (as in if user A is part of group A and group B then assign policy A, but if they are just part of group B assign policy B). This will work but requires multiple AD groups configured on domain controllers to work which I was hoping to avoid. Is there no way to just assign a policy based on username? I don't see it in ASDM for DAP configuration. On a side note, if I now have Anyconnect essentials enabled, what would be the impact to client-based Anyconnect VPN users by turning it off if I now have Anyconect premium licenses available on my ASA. Will they just start using the premium licenses when they connect rather the the essentials licenses. Any impact to the Anyconnect client install portal page? Thanks again for the reply here. Appreciate setting me set straight on this issue. EDIT: Looking through the link you provided, it seems that DAP takes the place of ASA tunnel groups and group polices. I'll look into the use of DAP some more. Thanks for the link., You don't require ""Advanced Endpoint Assessment"" to use DAP. If you do have such a licence it just means you can do more checks, like antivirus signature updates, etc. Without the licence you can still check AD groups and the like. I'm not sure with regards to the groups, but DAP is very flexible. See what match options there are, and how you might craft better matches. Remember you can match on other things like registry keys and the like, so perhaps you could check see if the users home directory exists or something. Be creative! Correct, just turn off essentials and install your premium licences. Remember when you turn off essentials, and if there are no other VPN licences, you automatically get two premium licences (built in). There will be no impact to your users., ps. If you think I helped it would be great if you could rate and mark the answer. :-)]",[0],1,2016-03-14,12937891,0,4,"We currently have Anyconnect (client based) up and running on our ASA 5515X running 9.5(1).

For e.g. you wish to allow the traffic from 192.158.44.0 on your side to 20.20.20.0 on the remote side. You can create natting in such a way that192.158.44.0 translates to192.158.22.101 and192.158.22.102. NOTE: Since you are translating whole subnet from192.158.44.0 to 2 IPs 192.158.22.101 and 102, so this will allow you to initiate the traffic from your side to get the tunnel up. The other side can not initiate the VPN tunnel up because this is Dynamic NAT. Once the tunnel is up, both sides can send/initiate the traffic. On ASA running 8.2, natting will look like nat (inside) 1 192.158.44.0 255.255.255.0 global (outside) 1 192.158.44.101-192.158.44.102 netmask 255.255.255.0 On ASA running 8.3 and above, nat will look like: object-group network net-192.158.44.101-102 network-object host 192.158.44.101 network-object host 192.158.44.102 object network obj-192.158.44.0 subnet 192.158.44.0 255.255.255.0 nat (inside,outside) dynamic net-192.158.44.101-102 Here is a link for your reference on natting: https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/33921/asa-pre-83-83-nat-configu...

Please rate helpful posts., Hi there, This didn't work, I even tried putting.22. in the group instead of.44. and nothing happening. I look at the results in the console and the source is all IPs in.44. and then the destination is original, surely that isn't right? This solution won't work for us long term anyway as it stops me accessing the internet when on the VPN which we need. I suspect it is because the whole range is being translated away and we are assigned an IP in this range when connecting. I think we need to be more specific. To confirm this is what I'd like to achieve: Log in to 192.158.44.101 Attempt to connect to client's server via RDP Our firewalltranslates IP to192.158.22.101 Clients firewallaccepts it and passes through to their server and RDP established. I don't mind doing fourseparate NATs, just need this working and not affecting other machines in anyway. Thanks for you assitance, Hi, Can you elaborate this: The question I have is how can I get the IPs192.158.44.101 and192.158.44.102 to become92.158.22.101 and92.158.22.102 before being sent out over this connection. I mean is this a typo or do we want it to translate to these IP's 92.158.22.101 and92.158.22.102? Regards, Aditya, I don't think it's a typo; you are correct when you say ""we want it to translate to these IP's 1 92.158.22.101 and 192.158.22.102"". These are the IPs that have been given to the other site as our local network (along with the peer). Our internal IPsare 1 92.158.44.101 and.102., Let me know if you need any more information to assist. Looks like there's a good reason why it is difficult. Could we set the internal IPs to translate to the range1 92.158.22.0 and then get our client to make the change on their firewall. Would that be easier?, Hi, We can do this by creating a manual NAT statement first that translates  192.158.44.101 and192.158.44.102 to become 192.158.22.101 and 192.158.22.102. Then for VPN we can have separate NAT statement specifying the destination subnet. If it is possible can you again explain the requirement? I would be in a state to provide you the config as well. Thanks, Aditya, Hi Aditya, Apologies, yourpost didn't show up before. These IPs are made up anyway so just suggest a sample config and I will adapt it. I think I've been clear with the requirements and you seem to understand fully from your post. If we can do the following then I think this is what we require: We can do this by creating a manual NAT statement first that translates  192.158.44.101 and192.158.44.102 to become 192.158.22.101 and 192.158.22.102.

Perhaps if you can share sanitized ""show tech"" removing all pertinent outputs in a text file, that will be great Regards, Dinesh Moudgil P.S. Please rate helpful posts., Hi Dinesh, thanks for the reply. I don't what the entire range of 192.158.44.0 to be translated. Just the two IPs I gave you.101 and.102. I've taken the configuration you've posted off because that isn't what I want and will cause us more problems. If you or Aditya can share a simple one to one configuration (it doesn't matter what the IPs are, I can change them) then that will be enough for me to get this running. Thanks for your time., Lets suppose you want all the users in inside on 5.5.5.0 to be natted to 1.1.1.1 and 1.1.1.2 when they talk to 20.20.20.0 off remote side.

Regards, Aditya Please rate helpful posts., Thanks both, I've gone with Aditya's configuration suggestion as this is more what we'd like to achieve. Unfortunately the NAT isn't working still. I had to make a change to one of the lines also due to the following error: ERROR: network: IP address/mask &lt;193.109.XXX.XX/255.255.255.0> doesn't pair I tried changing subnet to host and removing the netmask. It created the object but unfortunately hasn't worked. This might be a simple answer, do I need to ask the client what their netmask is on theircheckpoint 13500 or is the issue something else? I used the Peer IP address for this and they didn't actually provide a netmask. A quick reply would be appreciated as I can fire it off to them immediately, Hi, Yes you may need to check the netmask for it. Not sure why are we using a peer IP address in the NAT statement? Regards, Aditya, OK, thanks, what is this line for? I assumed peer as you were asking for it in a previous post and nothing else really made sense so what is it supposed to be? object network obj-remote subnet 10.x.x.x 255.255.255.0, Hi, This is for the remote subnet (local subnet) on the other end.

616,616,tsipoulanis,[user1],"[Hi, Flex VPN is a framework to configure IPsec VPN with IKE version 2 (IKEv2) on IOS platforms. You are correct that since IKEv2 is used it is more secure and faster. Dynamic tunnel configuration has been simplified in FlexVPN theoretically, youâd only need a single interface template on the Hub site to allow all types of incoming VPN connections. There are two types of tunnels in FlexVPN â static VTI and Virtual-template tunnels. Static VTI is used at the Spoke router to define a static tunnel (e.g. inter-Hub tunnel in dual-cloud topologies). The other type, Virtual-template,is literally a template, from which Hub instantiates (creates a copy of) another interface â Virtual-Access every time there is an incoming request from one of the Spokes. This interface is not tied to any source or destination and is referenced later from IKEv2 configuration. It must be configured on the Hub (to instantiate Tunnels to Spokes) as well as the Spokes (to allow Spoke-to-Spoke tunnels).

Once you get this certificate, import it into the new ASA. Regards, Dinesh Moudgil P.S.

If CA gave whole bundle then you can export and import and it should work fine. Usually CA just give ID cert so after export and import of ID cert,you will have to install root and sub-root cert on the ASA manually.

So for example if you have 3 private subnets that should be NATed publicly when reaching specific destinations, you may then create object groups for this like this: object-group networkPrivate_IPs  network-object host 192.168.120.1 network-object 192.168.X.X 255.255.255.X network-object host 192.168.X.X 255.255.255.X  object network TRANSLATED_IP_FOR_Private_IPs  host 99.99.99.99 -> An example(IP you have free for this) Object-group network IP_202.XXX.XXX.242  host202.XXX.XXX.242 Nat (inside,outside) source static Private_IPs TRANSLATED_IP_FOR_Private_IPs destination staticIP_202.XXX.XXX.242IP_202.XXX.XXX.242 You can modify the IP_202.XXX.XXX.242 object and instead use an object group with multiple destinations outside, Otherwise if you just do a PAT to the interface as the others, you will be forced to create 200 NAT exemptionlines, Please proceed to rate and mark as correct this post if it helped you! keep me posted! Regard, David Castro,, Hello Dean, I would recommend a Twice NAT basically that is the same terminology as a ""Policy NAT"", you can specify that your source Host will be translated to certain IP address only when it is addressed to certain destination or destinations, so basically you may create an object network with the IP address of the source, other network object with the Public IP which you want to use to translate the 192.168.x.x address and then the destination network object, so it will be like this: object network IP_192.168.120.1  host 192.168.120.1 object network TRANSLATED_IP_FOR_192.168.120.X  host 99.99.99.99 -> An example Object network IP_202.XXX.XXX.242  host202.XXX.XXX.242 Nat (inside,outside) source staticIP_192.168.120.1TRANSLATED_IP_FOR_192.168.120.X destination staticIP_202.XXX.XXX.242IP_202.XXX.XXX.242 This way the traffic that comes form 192.168.120.1 going through a VPN tunnel it will not matched this NAT statement, since this NAT statements states that it will be translated only when going to the 202.XXX.XXX.242 address, Now you may run a packet tracer and see how it goes, Please rate and mask as correct this answer if it helped you, keep me posted!

We need to check why we are getting this packet as an NON-IPSEC packet. You will need to identify the device that is sending that broadcast message and probably disable the component that is generating the broadcast, or you can place an access-list at some point of your network or on the inside of the ASA denying that source and destination. (source of the broadcast and the broadcast address) Since the IPSec VPN tunnels does not forward broadcast traffic you will see these syslog messages. Regards, Aditya Please rate helpful posts., Hi Robert, I understand you are getting the following error: ""CRYPTO-4-RECVD_PKT_NOT_IPSEC"" The config seems fine. ""Packet not IPsec"" messages here seem to indicate we occasionally have other type of traffic (not ipsec) coming in, that the ASA expected to be encrypted but that was not encapsulated into IPsec. This may be due to policy routing that bypasses the VPN gateway, or a spoofed/incorrect source IP address. In this case would be good idea set up packet captures in order to catch those packets and trace them back to their source. Also we see that this message comes from the first IP of the pool to the 10.11.10.255 IP which is what we need to track for UDP traffic. You can also check in the syslogs what UDP traffic is being sent for this.

To delete a list, use the no form of this command. To delete all split tunneling domain lists, use the no split-dns command without arguments. This deletes all configured split tunneling domain lists, including a null list created by issuing the split-dns none command. When there are no split tunneling domain lists, users inherit any that exist in the default group policy.

What I'm trying to discriminate are computers and not users, if the computer is part of the domain or not, right now I'm doing it with DAP + RegCheck but from DAP I cannot set a different address pool. I will check if I can scan the computer using the LDAP attributes. If you have any other suggestions you are welcome to share it:) Thanks again. Rolando A. Valenzuela., Hello Rolando, Correct me if I am wrong, based on the Computer(Domain where it belongs) you would like to map that to certain group policy, which will have certain attributes such as address pool, and that way you may differentiate, one domain to another, let's say: (Admins/Domain gets address pool of 10.10.10.0/24) (Vendors/Domain gets address pool of 10.20.20.0/24) Based on this I will give you my recommendations, if you want to do it based on the computer and not the user, I would recommend to get all the computers into the same Users group in Active Directory, so If you have a group of users (Admin/ Domain group)you may add the computers there, and with the LDAP attribute Mapping you will be able to map based on Membership to certain group Policy, that way all of the computers that the Admin users use, will be assigned to a group policy with several attributes such as the IP local Pool, if the users dont below to any of the groups announced, they wont be able to connect whatsoever, because you will need to create a NO-ACCESS group policy which will be used for the users that should not connect, You may find further information here:- http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-nex... Another way, will be filtering the PCs based on MAC address OUI t his function uses a regular expression in order to match the organizationally unique identifier (OUI) that will allowed the PCs to connect if those match the OUI defined in theregular expression with LUAregular expression this is possible, you may find this regular expression for example: assert(function () local pattern = ""^d067\.e5*"" local true_on_match = true local match = false for k,v in pairs(endpoint.device. MAC) do print(k) match = string.find(k, pattern) if (match) then if (true_on_match) then return true else return (false) end end end end)() So if the PCs are HP or Dell you may used the OUI part of the MAC address and define it over there, and Allow the user to connect and the user can then be mapped with the LDAP attribute Mapping to a group policy and they will be able to connect with a different IP address. (DAP cannot Assign IP address), it is a Dynamic Access Policy which works along with HostScan Posture Module in order to do Pre-assessment and as it says Posture Module, NOTE: The DAP itself gives you the option to filter by individual MAC address, so you dont need to do it by OUI, this is common for big companies that have a big amount of users so they prefer doing it by OUI which is easier, but you may define the individual MAC addresses Another way will be to use another regular expression so the DAP can examine the 3 first letters (Case Insensitive) of the PC and then allow it to connect if it matches the regular expression, if it does not, the connection will be terminated, you may find the regular expression here: assert(function() local match_pattern = ""^[Mm][Ss][Vv]""-> Those are the 3 first letters local match_value = endpoint.device. hostname--> Specifying hostname if (type(match_value) == ""string"") then if (string.find(match_value, match_pattern) ~= nil) then return true end elseif (type(match_value) == ""table"") then local k,v for k,v in pairs(match_value) do if (string.find(v, match_pattern) ~= nil) then return true end end end return false end)() Further LUA regular expressions:- http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-nex... For this to work you need AnyConnect Premium License (so yes you can use the two Default that comes with the ASA). Also, you need to have CSD or Hostscan image in the ASA and enabled so you can get that kind of information from the computers that connects with the AnyConnect. You can use the AnyConnect image as hostscan image. (remember to enable Endpoint Attributes through ASDM in the CSD section, otherwise this is not going to work). The previous mentioned are good options for you to explore, but  it's not going to be very scalable(Depending on how many users), so I recommend that a registry key check with "" Domain Name"" or file check would work best but its your CUs call whether he still wants MAC check or not.

Each remote site should be able to ping the inside of both ASA's. Start be getting it to this point., There are already routes to the other site via the point to point. Would I need to add a different route?, You need a route on both sites to the other site on the ASA's. Have you got a route on both ASA's?, Yes. On Site A there is route inside 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.200.1 Site B: route inside 192.168.200.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1, Can one ASA ping the inside interface of the other ASA?, Yes, they both can., You have used the same VPN address pool at both sites. This needs to be unique (allocate a unique /24 for each ASA). Then on each ASA you need to add another route for the remote VPN pool. The Cisco 881's all also need routes for these pools., That was actually a mistaken copy and paste on my part. Site B is actually 10.250.250.0. Ill try adding routes to the 881's, You are close to getting it going now., Is the 881 the default route for both sites?, The routes on the 881's confuse me some. For Example, Site B's ""ptp router"": interface FastEthernet4 description INTERFACE TO PTP FIBER TO MWT ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.252 ip virtual-reassembly! interface Vlan1 description INTERFACE TO LAN ip address 192.168.200.1 255.255.255.0! ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.200.254 ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2 ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2, That is the router for Site ""B"". You can tell by the IP address on the VLAN interface., Right. I didn't type it correctly there, it's fixed. This is Site A's: interface FastEthernet4 description INTERFACE TO GRAND RIVERS PTP ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.252 duplex auto speed auto! interface Vlan1 description INTERFACE TO LAN ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.253 ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.253 ip route 192.168.200.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.1, You are still missing the routes for the VPN pools. On site 'A' 881 you need: ip route 10.251.251.0255.255.255.0 10.10.10.1 On site 'B' 881 you need: ip route 10.250.250.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2, I had tried these previously. I went ahead and put them back in there but I still cannot ping site B when connected to Site A., On each ASA you need two of the below lines. One for the local internal lan subnet, and another for the remote lan subnet. IN eahc case it should use the lobal VPN subnet (the pool of addresses). nat (inside,outside) source static INTERNAL_SUBNET INTERNAL_SUBNET destination static VPN_SUBNET VPN_SUBNET, I still cannot ping site B, but it also seems to have broken DNS. I could ping things on Site A but only by IP for some reason. Previously I could ping by name., Perhaps post a fresh config for the ASA you are connecting to., Here they are. Attachment: site_a.txt site_b_config.txt, This is getting tricky, as you are switching what you called site A. In the first post site A has the subnet 192.168.1.x. In the config attached above site A has the subnet 192.168.200.x., For the ASA with the IP address 192.168.200.254, change the below ACL has it has two lines in it, instead of 1. access-list split_tunnel standard permit 192.168.200.0 255.255.255.0 access-list split_tunnel standard permit 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0, Adding this fixed it. I am able to traverse both sides when connected via Anyconnect. Thank you so much!, Yay! Please rate and mark as correct those response which helped you. :-), I apologize. I'm getting confused calling them A & B as well. Haha. I've fixed the uploaded configs., add below command same security traffic permit intra-interface traffic is hair-pinning from one site to another please add this command on ASA terminating the VPN share the packet tracer output from the VPn terminating ASA packet-tracer input outsideicmp&lt;pool ip >8 0 &lt;destination IP> detail and on outside interface allow icmp any any (for testing) share the output of below command sh run all sysopt, Ive also attached the correct Site B config to the original post now., Hello how's the fiber connected?is it direct IP connectivity or you have a site to site tunnel between site A and site B? if you have L2L tunnel then you will have to modify the crypto ACLs, if you have IP traffic without encryption then you need to have reverse routes f or the VPN POOL traffic on the site B network devices.....eg: as per your config you will need routes for 10.251.251.1/24 pointing to the site A on hop my hop basis;) hopethat helps regards #Rohan, It's direct connectivity. From the port on the fiber NID it's plugged into a 881. The ASA has a route pointing the traffic for the remote site to the router., when the client is connectedto ASA 1 on site A........from ASA2 on site B are you able to ping the the client IP eg 10.251.251.1?, No, I cannot., on Site 2...ASA2 add routing for the client pool network eg: route vlan2 10.251.251.0 255.255.255.0 2.2.2.2  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;were 2.2.2.2 should be your fibergateway then test ping from the ASA2 to the client10.251.251.1, Still can't ping it.]","[15, 20]",1,2016-02-24,12923696,0,32,I have AnyConnect setup at two locations.

637,637,spencerallsop,"[user1, asker, user1, user2, asker]","[Try jumping to something a bit more modern like 9.2(4). You could also try upgrading the remote ends, but this should not usually be needed., I'd love to, but I'm limited to my 5520, therefore at 9.1(x). 9.2+ isn't supported on this platform, Bummer. I see there is a 9.1(7) interim release available., Hello Spencerallsop, I would recommend you to add the ""no-proxy-arp"" keyword at the end of NAT statement, so the ASA won't try to respond ARP requests for the destination traffic (VPN interesting traffic), also this last phase 9 usually shows dropped due to a VPN filter defined in a group policy sometimes, make sure you dont have a VPN filter in a group policy affecting this tunnel, so you will need to do the following: 1. Remove the NAT statement:  - no nat (teeessyou,outside) source static any any destination static teeessyou_ENCODERS teeessyou_ENCODERS 2. Correct the NAT statement with the ""no-proxy-arp"" keyword: -  nat (teeessyou,outside) source static any any destination static teeessyou_ENCODERS teeessyou_ENCODERS no-proxy-arp 3. Clear the VPN ISA SA:  - clear crypto ikev1 sa &lt;Peer IP address> 4. Run the packet tracer to verify the L2L has come up, To be honest I would not recommend you to move to 9.1.7, since it has some issues with ARP entries, and it affects AnyConnect SSL somehow, which still is under investigation, Actually this bug affects 9.1.7 (may affect your environment):- https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuy28710 Please dont forget to rate and mark as correct this post, keep me posted! Regards, David Castro,, I think the take away message here is keep away from 9.1.7. I've rolled back to a previous version, as mentioned before, and everything works. I've even dropped back to a patched version from the 9.0 releases, and the ASAs just don't connect. I suspect that the 'fix' for the IKE vulnerability has actually broken some other stuff, apart from the ARP bug that we've seen. I've reported to TAC through my vendor support- and interestingly, this was a known issue, but no workaround or fix was offered.

647,647,michael_laubach,"[user1, user2, user3]","[I have been sticking with the older 3.x clients myself so far. I tested a 4.x client just to make sure it works, and as you have noted, it does. My understanding is you need the new licences to use any of the newer 4.x features, so you don't gain a lot if you are using the older AnyConnect licences. This is the AnyConnect 4.x licence agreement. A quick read suggests to me you need the Apex or Plus licence to use it. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyconnect40/license/end_user/AnyConnect-SEULA-v4-x.html For purposes of this SEULA, the product You have ordered or enabled is any of the following software products and/or the referenced functionality (the ""Software""): Cisco AnyConnect: Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client v4.0 or above, all modules, all operating systems, with o  Cisco AnyConnect Apex License, and/or o  Cisco AnyConnect Plus License, Thank you both for your reply.:-) So I will stick to the newest Anyconnect 3.1 client and also roll this one out via the firewall. Thanks, Michael, Philip is correct. If the client has a legitimate license to use AC 4.x (i.e obtained by being a licensed user of an AC-4.x licensed headend), they can connect to any lower level ASA or IOS router SSL VPN headend. I always have the latest AC and use it to connect to a wide variety of customer VPNs. To deploy the package from a given headend, you must have a license to do so. It is not enforced by technical means, but is part of the Terms and Conditions you agree to as part of the End User License Agreement (EULA) when downloading the AC 4.x pkg files from cisco.com. It is even more confusing than usual lately as Cisco transitions from one already complex licensing model to one that's hopefully in the long term less complex, while retaining full interoperability between the two.]","[0, 2]",1,2016-02-15,12914871,0,3,"Hello, We operate a Cisco ASA5520 cluster with an 8.4 software release and ""Anyconnect Premium"" licenses.

The issue is that I cannot selectively encrypt traffic that goes across the tunnel because crypto profiles do not support ACLs. So, I had to use PBR on the LAN i/f to direct all EF traffic to the PE (avoiding the routing table's 0/0 which is being learnt via the Tunnel). I am trying to find out if there are other ways to achieve selective encryption (ie.EF traffic should not be encrypted but all others should be). Not that its not working now but there will be issues when the CPE doesn't have a next-hop IP to a PE (for PPPoE/ADSL type of WAN connections which have a route to the dialer only. Many thanks,, The PBR you have given looks like it should work to me (at least for icmp traffic marked as EF)., The PBR works fine, yes. On DMVPNs, is there any other ways of doing selective encryption, as crypto profiles don't do acls. If not, then I will stick with PBR. Many thanks for your quick response. Cheers, With DMVPN, no. You would have to go back to using just crypto maps, which only use access-lists to control what is and is not encrypted. If the ""EF"" traffic was from dedicated VoIP subnets then you would have more options, as you could simply choose not to route those subnets over the Tunnel., However I still can not understand why you can't send all the traffic over the tunnel and stick to using simple DMVPN with encryption.

What size circuits are the spokes going to have?, Hubs (2) will be about 200Mbps Spokes will be about 20- 50 Mbps as i have understand, my plan is to keep the voice traffic to our MPLS Netzwork(keeping better quality for our telefones), and the rest of the traffic will be routed in DMVPN Network., Here is a comparison of the 4000 series routers. I think I would go for the cheaper 4431. If money is no object stick with the 4451. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/4000-series-integrated-services-routers-isr/models-comparison.html Make sure you get an HSEC licence as well, otherwise the crypto throughput is severely limited. I would also get the AppX licence. For the spokes, if it was my money, I would like to have the 890 series routers. They can flat line a 100Mb/s circuit, and come with ""Advanced IP"", so can run BGP, EIGRP, etc. Basically no restrictions. A Cisco 897VA is particularly versatile. Note you can order a rack mount bracket seperately for the 890 series if you want to rack mount the routers. The 897 has ADSL, VDSL, and a Gigabit WAN Copper/Fibre port built in. It can plug into a lot ofWAN circuits as a result., thank you very much, your answer verify my research. we will see our Budget and based on that we will go for the 4431 or the 4451 just to be more secure with the solution. Can you please tell my the critiria you saw based on the infos i have given for the Hub Device? for the spokes i am thinking for sure 890 Series. but i was thinking if it needs a bigger router for an office with more than 150 users., The main criteria was required throughput. If you are putting in 200Mb/s circuits, then the total aggregate router throughput needed is 400Mb/s (200Mb/s send and 200Mb/s receive). You then want a little bit of room to grow, in case you make the circuits bigger in the future. The 4431 has 500Mb/s of throughput, and you can buy a licence which increases this to 1Gb/s. So this router has a lot of room for expansion., Perfect one more time, really thank you. is exactly what i have calculated for our internal LAN / Network,for every switch;) then it means that i have to think the same for every Spoke, if we havea 20Mbps, I need minumum a router with 40Mbps http://www.cisco.com/web/partners/downloads/765/tools/quickreference/rou... from that pdf, is the ""Fast/CEF Switching "" what i have to think about? I am asking, because i dont see any infos for the 890 Series in other links. For bigger Routers it was easy and i found it., I don't think there is any public performance data on the 890 series that I can point you to. But trust me, it can flat line a 100Mb/s Internet circuit (with IPSec, NAT, QoS and zone based firewall enabled) and still have a little horse power left over., thank you very much for your infos, and yes you are right, i will not trust it;) I just found a new love, for the small office, C891-24X, is amazing. is a bit more expensive but you save some money, instead of buing a switch;) now the managers will decice, but i am sure I have everything and in the best quality. Thank you again., for the 890 Series, i have found also this one, http://anticisco.ru/pubs/ISR_G2_Perfomance.pdf I think it is updated and ok, isnt?, I'm not sure you can trust something very much with the name ""anticisco"" in it- but I believe the numbers are correct., Actually you should check out the C891-24X as well. It has a built in 24 port switch, which might be very handy for some of your smaller offices. It has dual Gigabit WAN links as well (even has dual SFP's).

To look up the user license purchased or term remaining, please access your support contract through the Cisco Service Contract Center. So this new licensingmodule will enable to total amount of connections that your ASA hardware supports but you should only use 75 connections because that's what you paid for. Regards, please rate., Thanks for your answer. I'm not sure the old 25 premium license were converted to apex or just lost., You can check his licensing FAQ: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/anyconnect-secure-mob... But I don't think the current license will be converted., It is not converted:(.. anywaydoes it means that even though I have 50 APEX I could have 750 user connected with AnyConnect?, AnyConnect licenses are not additive. If you installed the activation-key / license for 50 Apex then you are licensed for 50 Apex users. That overwrites the old license which is no longer installed- you can revert to it only if you have the old activation key., Thanks Marvin so I'll try to assign the old license to another ASA. Is migration to APEX still possible or has it ended on December 31 2015? If you installed the activation-key / license for 50 Apex then you are licensed for 50 Apex users. Does it means that I cannot have more then 50 activeanyconnect users at the same time? if so why in the activation-keysent by Cisco I have 750 AnyConnect Premium Peers (which is the ASA 5520 limit)?, Based on the ordering guide: ""The number of licenses needed is based on all the possible unique users that may use any Cisco AnyConnect service. The exact number of Plus or Apex licenses should be based on the total number of unique users that require the specific services associated with each license type."" I think it means that new APEX license is no longer of concurrent users but to all potential users of the AnyConnect service., You're welcome. The old activation key is tied to the serial number of the ASA it was issued for and is not transferable. (Cisco will override that policy in the case of a failed unit being RMAd.) You can have more than 50 users active but you would technically be in violation of the terms of your license. However, there's no technical enforcement of that at this time with AnyConnect 4.x licenses (Apex or Plus). Technically the users licensed are unique userids (not concurrent users). The way Cisco explains it is if you have a given user with PC and tablet both on VPN then that uses only one license. However they haven't figured out how to differentiate that for enforcement purposes yet while maintaining compatibility with the old license types in the same code so they just open it up to the max the hardware supports when you activate a new style license.]","[4, 7]",1,2016-02-07,12883396,0,8,"Hello, I haveAnyConnect 25 premium peers license, AnyConnect Premium Peers: 25 perpetual Other VPN Peers: 750 perpetual Total VPN Peers: 750 perpetual AnyConnect for Mobile: Disabled perpetual AnyConnect for Cisco VPN Phone: Disabled perpetual ThenI've bought AnyConnect 50 userApex license.

Issue the command: ldap-over-ssl enable on the aaa-server host properties. Check that the ASA license supports 3DES-AES in order to do LDAP-S, under ""show version"". The Login DN (the user used for the Binding operation, sometimes called the Binding DN) must have Account Operators privileges for password management changes. Super-user level privileges are not required for the Login/Bind DN. The domain controller(s) that you are authenticating to must support LDAPS. You can accomplish this by installing Certificate Services on the domain controller and rebooting it. Once that is done, it will accept LDAPS queries. You must enable password-expire-in-days &lt;# of days> under tunnel-group to notify users that their password will be expiring. If you do not specify that, users will not be notified but will still be able to change their password once it expires.

I guess you could try clearing the related SA, and make sure it rebuilds. You definitely need that bit right first. I'm not sure I can offer much more help without seeing your config and understanding the topology., I don't have access to the configs at the moment, but basically I have object groups ""LOCAL-NETS and REMOTE-NETS"" that my crypto map ACL references. I just added the networks into the LOCAL-NETS object group. But when I perform a ""show crypto IPsec sa"" its not showing the new networks. Adding them to the crypto map should add them to the encryption domain, correct?, Yes, that should add them to the encryption domain on your end. Have you added them to any relevant NAT configuration as well (like the existing encryption domain)?, Hello, You must bounce the tunnel whenever you modify the interesting traffic otherwise the new SA is not going to be created, is kind of funny that you say that the SA is already build atthe remote side, the SA cannot be established only in one side, is like building a new tunnel if you don't have it in one side it can't just establish itself and create the entry for the SA. Besides adding the new networks and bouncing the tunnel you need to generate traffic to trigger the new SA or you will never see it created. Check your no nats and routing and it should work. Regards, please rate., Just curious, but when the SA expires and rekey's will the new networks then be included if I don't bounce the tunnel? I believe I have my ACL's and NAT correct, when I run a packet tracer the traffic of the new network is getting dropped when hitting the tunnel. (which I believe will be resolved when I bounce it), When a rekey happens the current SAs will negociatenew ones I donÂ´t think the tunnel will actually drop on every rekey. I recently worked on a case where a new SA was not coming up while I got the configuration from the customer and I reviewed it took like 2 days all the configuration was fine but up until we manually bounced the tunnel the SA was able to establish, a couple of rekeys definitely occurred during those 2 days. When you modify the interesting traffic you just bounce the tunnel you donÂ´t wait for the next rekey to occur for the SA to come up but based on that experience I will say rekey wont make it. Give it a try manually dropping it an let us know.]",[3],1,2016-02-07,12883261,0,6,"Good Evening All, I am seeking help and/or advise in regards to adding more networks to the encryption domain of an existing site to site IPsec tunnel.

It makes creating redundant back up links easy. Cisco have a marketing term called iWAN that is more encompassing and builds on DMVPN. This is the validated design guide explaining the deployments options and how to configure it. http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/solutions/CVD/Jan2015/CVD-IWANDesignGuide-JAN15.pdf, yes I respect and understand that solution and your idea, but the point is that the manager wants todecrease the cost. thats why i was thinking for the DMVPN solution with a normal ISP Internet. then we will configure and implement, and in the future support the Company Network. but as i read some people have some issues with the Quality of the VoiP. maybe like a second solution could be to to use the MLPS for the large offices and for the small the DMVPN. or then i was thinking like two DMVPN(then we have also a redudance/backup) and to split the services, for example one DMVPN for the voip traffic and the second one for Data and other services., Yes you can run it only over the Internet. Yes you can have VoIP issues. A solution we have used in the past is dual internet connections. You dedicate one to VoIP, and one for everything else. Still much cheaper that MPLS. You can also use Pfr (Performance Routing) to select the circuit to use based on the latency and jitter and type of traffic. http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/PfR3:Solutions:IWAN, Hi Philip, thank you so much for your quick responds. Is exactly what i was thinking.;) I appreciate your help, best regards, Thomas, an extra small question, maybe a bit stupid, but i am not the expert in voip.... if we have a site to site VPN for some offices, is possible one telefon to communicate with an other telefon which is located in other office? as a basic knowledge i have for voip, normal the telefon take infos from call manager, and then has direct connection with the other telefon. for the example with 2 Site to Site VPNs, eather they communicate through the central location or is not possible to communicate those telefones which are located in different office with site to site vpn, is that correct? and if that is correct, that is the main reason why we need mpls or dmvpn.right?]",[2],1,2016-02-04,12881351,0,5,"Hello to everyone, we have about 40 Branches and a Central DataCenter. every office is connected with the DC and all the internet traffic passed and filtered from DC, from the Central Firewall. we have VoiP, with a Central Call Manager in DC. our data are in DC, except some of the offices which have their own File Server. also RDP is importand to use.

But in 2015 the licensing schema for Anyconnect was changed. Today, "" AnyConnect for Mobile "" license is out-of-date license. I'm not sure, if it is possible to order this license today. According to new licensing schema, you should migrate from Anyconnect Premium license to a new license, called ""Anyconnect Apex"". With new license ""Anyconnect Apex"" you don't need to have "" AnyConnect for Mobile "" anymore. The mobile devices will be able to connect using Anyconnect client. The migration from Anyconnect Premium to Anyconnect Apex is free of charge. But, please, pay an attention, the new licenses are subscriptions. So, after the migration to Apex licenses, you'll get a subscription for 3 years. After 3 years you'll have to renew your subscription, and it won't be free of charge., I have just checked the availability of ""free of charge"" migration licese (L-AC-APX-M-3YR-G=) in Cisco Commerce Workspace, and it seems, that migration license is also not available anymore. I advice you to check this information with your official reseller. For more information, please, see the Ordering Guide for Anyconnect: http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/security/anyconnect-og.pdf, Boris- the free migration offer expired 31 December 2015. Note that both AnyConnect Plus and Apex license levels include mobile device licensing. The primary reasons one would go to the Apex license level are to use clientless SSL VPN and Posture Assessment (similar to the old Advanced Endpoint Assessment separate license). Also, the available terms are 1, 3 and 5 years. Plus is available as a perpetual license at a cost slightly more than a 5 year term., Marvin, thanks a lot for your additions!]",[0],1,2016-02-04,12881226,0,4,"Hi I've got a couple of ASA5525-X units with premium VPN licenses, now when I connect with the Any Connect client for Androind.
